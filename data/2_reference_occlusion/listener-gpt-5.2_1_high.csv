I need to refer to the target image that's highlighted with a dashed red box. It's a five-point star outline, black, with inner vertical stripes in gray and white. I want to instruct my partner to select it among a grid of images. There's also a triangle with a green border and a wavy pattern nearby.

I’m working on parsing the 3x3 grid from the image. The objects in the grid include a red/black striped rectangle at the top middle cell, a blue outlined star in the middle left, and a green triangle in the middle right. The bottom right cell has a black outlined star with gray vertical stripes, which matches the prompt. So, the coordinates for that star are column 3, row 3. I'll simply output ""3 3.""",TRUE,

I need to create a referential description of a grid layout, probably a 3x3 structure, but it has many blanks. I notice a specific target: a black star at the bottom-right with wavy stripes in gray and white. It has a thick black outline.

I need to identify something in a 3x3 grid. Looking at the bottom row, I see shapes: on the left, there's a green five-point star with vertical stripes, and in the bottom right, there's a black star with gray wavy horizontal stripes. It seems the requested shape matches that description: a five-point star with a thick black outline and filled with gray wavy zigzag stripes. So, it belongs in cell 3, 3. I'll return ""3 3"".",TRUE,

I need to create a clear description for a target. The dashed red box highlights the top right cell. The shape is a 5-point star with a black outline and a fill of grey polka dots.

I need to identify the column and row for a grid. It's a simple 3x3 layout. The star, which has a thick black outline with light gray polka dots, is located at the top right of the grid, specifically in column 3, row 1. The user wants the column and row numbers.

I need to identify an object that has a red outline shaped like a triangle, filled with small gray polka dots, and it seems to sit in a 3x3 grid.

I see that we’re working with a 3x3 grid, which means there are 3 columns and 3 rows.
