I need to choose how to describe the target object, which is a star with specific features, like the dashed red box star option. I have to ensure clarity since the user can see everything, including what's behind the curtains. I can't use directional terms like left or right, so I should focus on unique features, like the black outline and wavy gray interior. However, there could be others with similar features hidden, so I have to describe everything I know without assuming additional details."

I’m working on creating a referring expression for a specific target: the dashed red box that contains a star outline in black filled with grey polka dots. I can see there are other objects nearby, like a green-bordered square and a red-bordered triangle, but I need to avoid using any spatial terms. I want a descriptive phrase that clearly separates the target star from the others, like “the white star with grey polka dots and a thin black outline.”"

I need to clearly describe a target shape without using positional references like ""top left."" Looking at the 3x3 grid, I see that the top row is blank. The middle row has a red-outlined triangle with grey dots, which is my target. I also notice a blue-bordered square with vertical stripes and some other shapes below. To instruct, I should say, ""Select the triangle with grey dots inside, which sets it apart from circles and squares."""
