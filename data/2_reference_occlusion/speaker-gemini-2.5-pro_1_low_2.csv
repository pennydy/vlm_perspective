exp2_001.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,2,"triangle, triangular",black,stripe,"3,3",The triangle with vertical stripes.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, here's how I'm approaching this reference game. The user wants me to be a speaker, and my job is to accurately describe a target object within an image so that someone else can correctly identify it. I need to be precise, unambiguous, and avoid any information the listener wouldn't have access to, like the dashed red box I see.

First, I examined the image. It's a 3x3 grid, and I can see three objects: a triangle with wavy lines, a star with wavy lines, and another triangle with vertical stripes. The target is highlighted, and it's the triangle with the vertical stripes in the bottom-right cell.

I immediately identify the distractors: the other two objects are the triangle with wavy lines and the star with wavy lines. My task is now to differentiate the target from these two.

I can't rely on spatial references like ""bottom-right,"" because the grid's layout might be different for the listener. I can also not mention any elements on the image like the dashed red box. I always need to keep in mind that other objects could be hidden in the future, even if not in this image.

I systematically compare the objects. The target is a triangle with vertical stripes. The first distractor is a triangle with wavy lines, and the second is a star with wavy lines.

The shape itself isn't enough, since there are two triangles. The unique differentiator is the pattern. The target has vertical stripes, and the distractors both have wavy lines.

Therefore, I'm constructing a descriptive phrase by identifying the shape and then focusing on the unique pattern, as the pattern is the differentiator. I'm considering a few options:

*   ""The object with vertical stripes""
*   ""The triangle with vertical stripes""
*   ""The shape with straight lines inside.""

All three would work. The phrase ""The triangle with vertical stripes"" is concise and unambiguous. ""The object with vertical stripes"" is even shorter, while ""The shape with straight lines inside"" is slightly less clear and uses an additional word.

Based on clarity and efficiency, I believe ""The triangle with vertical stripes"" is the optimal description. It quickly narrows down the options to the triangles and then uses the unique pattern to pinpoint the exact target. It's concise and accurate, and it avoids any reliance on visual cues the listener wouldn't share.

exp2_002.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,square,blue,checker,"3,2",The square with a checkerboard pattern and a blue border.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to guide the listener to the specific target object within this grid. I'm seeing a 3x3 array of visuals, and the highlighted target is nestled in the middle, a checkerboard pattern with a blue border.

First, I broke down the visual field. I have a star with polka dots, some blank spaces, question-mark-laden curtains, the target checkerboard, and a wavy pattern.  I've mentally registered each object, noting their salient features. The curtains are interesting because I assume the listener has seen what's behind them, and I haven't. So I should stick to describing what's visible.

Now, for the target. It's a square. Inside it, I see a classic grey and white checkerboard design. Crucially, it has a solid blue border. The other visual cues are the distractors, but they do have distinct features: the star, the wavy pattern with a green border, and the curtains with mystery boxes behind them. These are all useful contrasts for my eventual description.

The key is crafting a concise yet unambiguous description that differentiates the target from the other elements in the grid. ""The checkerboard pattern"" is a good start, but it's not specific enough. I'll need to add distinguishing details.  ""The square with the checkerboard pattern"" is an improvement, but still, I can make it even better. Mentioning the color, ""The grey and white checkerboard pattern"" is better. The border is a game-changer! ""The checkerboard pattern with the blue border"" would be great. The other patterned object is a wavy pattern with a green border.

So I've tested various formulations. I rejected anything spatial like ""middle row, right column"", and the best options are: ""Select the square with the checker-board pattern and a blue border"" or ""It's the grey and white checkerboard with the blue frame."" I need to keep it simple but complete.

Finally, I checked: does the description rely on location? No. Does it uniquely identify the target? Yes. Is it concise? Yes.

I'm settling on something that leverages both the pattern and the border color, since those are the most unique features. ""The checkerboard pattern with the blue border"" it is. That's concise, clear, and unambiguous. It should do the trick.
"
exp2_003.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,4,"circle, circular",red,"wavy, zigzag","1,3",The object is a circle with a gray wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My goal is to craft a description for the listener to identify the target object. It's crucial to be precise, especially since I don't have complete information about everything in the scene.

First, I identified the target: it's a circle with a reddish border and a gray wavy pattern. I also see some other objects: a blue star with a checkered pattern, a black star with a polka dot pattern, and two red curtains each with a white question mark. I can’t see what's behind the curtains.

Now, it's about distinguishing the target from the distractors. Shape is a great starting point – it's a circle. The others are stars. However, I can't rely solely on shape, because other circles *might* be hidden. The wavy pattern is distinctive, too, but again, I can't be sure there isn’t another wavy pattern behind a curtain. The color of the border is an option but might not be as clear.

The key is robustness. I need a description that differentiates the target even if there are hidden objects. A single attribute may not be sufficient. ""The circle"" might be ambiguous. ""The object with the wavy pattern"" is also potentially ambiguous. I have to avoid using spatial locations. So, I combined the shape and pattern. ""The circle with the wavy pattern"" seems promising and is more robust. I can specify the color too.

From the listener’s perspective, they see everything and will know if there are other circles. If there is only one circle, ""the circle"" is enough. If there are other circles, ""the circle with the wavy pattern"" will be better.

To be concise and complete, I will go with ""the circle with the gray wavy pattern."" This uses two distinguishing features, the circle shape (which is unique from what I see) and the wavy pattern inside (unique amongst the visible objects, and very likely also unique from any potential hidden objects). The listener will then be able to easily identify the target object. The emphasis is on clear and unambiguous communication, combining a unique shape and unique internal pattern. This is a robust description.
"
exp2_004.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,square,blue,checker,"3,3",The square with the checkerboard pattern.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the highlighted target object so precisely that someone else can pick it out, even if they see things a bit differently. I can't use spatial cues, which means I'm relying purely on visual properties. Let me break down my thought process:

First, I need to *identify* the object. Ah, it's a square with a blue border, and inside, there's a gray and white checkerboard pattern. Got it.

Next, I'll quickly *scan the distractors* to see what I'm up against. There's a black-outlined triangle with gray dots, a green-outlined star with gray dots, and a blue-outlined star with gray vertical stripes. Right, these are my rivals. Empty cells are irrelevant for this task; I just need to focus on these visible, competing objects.

Now comes the crucial part: formulating a unique description. Let's think through the object's features and how they differentiate it:

*   **Shape:** It's a square. Bingo! That's unique among the presented shapes. The other objects are a triangle and two stars.
*   **Pattern:** It's a checkerboard pattern. Also unique. The others have dots or stripes.
*   **Color:** The border is blue, and the checkerboard itself is gray and white. Blue is shared by one of the stars, but the shape and pattern are different.

With these features, how can I be succinct, accurate, and unambiguous? I'm going to start by combining the most distinguishing features: The shape and the pattern. The square with the checkerboard is the best starting point.

Here's where I consider several versions:

*   ""It's a square with a checkerboard pattern inside."" Very clear.
*   ""The object with a blue border that is a square."" A bit wordy.
*   ""The gray and white checkerboard."" Concise but lacks the shape, which could also be useful.

I can make these simpler too. ""The square."" That works because there's only one square presented. Likewise, ""The checkerboard."" works because there's only one of that pattern present.

I want something robust. ""The square with the checkerboard pattern."" combines both features nicely. Is there anything else that would create confusion? No. The square and checkerboard are both unique.

I need a simple, direct description. The best approach is to focus on what makes the object different, and, importantly, what it shares with no other. The square and checkerboard are very salient.

So, after these considerations, I've narrowed it down to: ""The square with the checkerboard pattern."" I believe this is the most effective. I also think ""The checkerboard"" alone could be sufficient. Finally, in some cases a more complete description might be useful: ""The square with a blue border and a gray and white checkerboard inside."" But ""The square with the checkerboard pattern"" is my preferred choice. It hits that sweet spot of conciseness and precision, which is what I'm aiming for.
"
exp2_005.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,square,blue,"wavy, zigzag","2,3",The shape with the wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My task is to describe this object so someone else can pick it out. First things first, let's nail down what the target is. It's a square, sitting in the bottom middle cell of a 3x3 grid. It has a blue border and a gray and white wavy pattern inside.

Now, I've got to consider the other objects to make sure my description is unambiguous. Up in the top-left, there's a blue-bordered triangle with a checkered pattern. Top-middle? A red-bordered square, also checkered. And finally, bottom-left is a blue-bordered star with a striped pattern. The other cells are empty.

My objective is to construct a description that uniquely singles out the target object. ""The square"" is too vague because there's another one. ""The one with the blue border"" is also insufficient, as two other shapes share that characteristic. The wavy pattern is the key differentiator – no one else has it! So, ""the object with the wavy pattern"" seems promising.

I need to evaluate my options and choose the most effective and concise description. ""The square with the wavy pattern"" is definitely unambiguous. ""The object with the wavy pattern"" is also a strong contender. Let's make sure that is the best choice:
""The shape with the wavy lines inside."" That is a better description than the previous, as it does not include an ambiguity the shape. I need to make a final comparison between the potential descriptions before deciding.

I could say, ""The square with the blue border."" But, that requires the listener to narrow down the choices by shape, then by color. Alternatively, ""The shape with the wavy pattern"" will make it easy to find by scanning all shapes for the pattern.

It looks like the wavy pattern is the winning factor. It's distinctive, unique, and jumps out visually. ""The shape with the wavy pattern"" is a direct and efficient description. It's concise and it immediately separates the target. That's the one I'll use.
"
exp2_006.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,"circle, circular",black,checker,"2,1",The circle with the checkerboard pattern.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being asked to play a reference game. My task is to describe this object in a way that allows someone else to identify it without any ambiguity. The critical thing here is to make it easy and efficient. I'm focusing on the *target* object, and this whole red dashed box thing is a strong cue that I should pay *close* attention to it.

First, I need to understand what I'm looking at. It's a circle in the 3x3 grid, top row, middle column. The outline is black, and the fill pattern is a grey and white checkerboard. That's a good starting point. I can immediately see the need to distinguish this from the other items in the grid.

Now, I look at the distractors. There's a triangle with a red outline and the same checkerboard pattern, a square with a blue outline and grey polka dots, a star with a blue outline and a checkerboard pattern, and another circle with a red outline and grey wavy lines. Four cells are empty. This is crucial for comparison and forming a description.

Next, I need to come up with a description that separates this target from everything else. I consider each property in turn:

*   **Shape:** It's a circle. But there's another circle! ""The circle"" is not enough.
*   **Outline Color:** It has a black outline. Nobody else does. This is unique!
*   **Fill Pattern:** It's a checkerboard. Okay, the triangle and the star also have a checkerboard pattern. ""The checkerboard pattern"" is not enough.

Then, I try combining these features:

*   ""The circle with a checkerboard pattern"" is unique. The other circle is different. The other checkerboard objects are different. It's a *good* description.
*   ""The object with the black outline"" is also unique. It's short and to the point.
*   ""The circle with the black outline"" is also great. Combines shape and color.

I evaluate my options. ""The object with the black outline"" is concise, leaning on a single, unique feature. ""The circle with the checkerboard pattern"" also works, using shape and pattern. I'm avoiding any degenerate spatial references like ""top row,"" per the instructions, since that's not robust.

I'm starting to think about which is best, and whether either has issues. The color black needs to be really, really black. The checkerboard pattern *has* to be definitive. The shape is definitely a circle. Okay, both seem robust.

So now I try combining them for clarity: ""The circle with a black outline and a checkerboard pattern."" A little verbose, but precise. How about more concise? ""The black-outlined circle with a checkerboard pattern."" Trying to focus on one unique combination, I can say ""The circle with a checkerboard pattern"" and it works since the other circle is wavy and the checkerboard shapes have a different outline. Same with ""the circle with a black outline"". Even ""The object with a checkerboard pattern and a black outline"" is valid.

Given these, ""The circle with a checkerboard pattern"" feels the best. It's concise and uses two identifiable attributes. Let's see if this is robust.

Does another circle have a checkerboard pattern? No. The listener's context is: a target, another checkerboard pattern, and a circle with a wavy pattern, a square, and a triangle. By saying ""circle,"" I immediately exclude the others. By saying ""with a checkerboard pattern,"" I eliminate the other circle. Bingo!

Or, I could say ""the object with a black outline,"" which also excludes every other item! Triangle has red. Square has blue. Star has blue. Other circle has red.

Which is better? Single unique feature or combination of common features? While ""the object with the black outline"" is nice and concise, ""the circle with a checkerboard pattern"" feels more descriptive, and might be less prone to misinterpretation if the black outline is perceived as a very dark grey. So, I will go with the combination of shape and pattern.
"
exp2_007.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,"circle, circular",red,stripe,"1,3",The striped circle with the red border.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object within this grid so that someone else can correctly identify it. I need to be precise, unambiguous, and avoid using any spatial terms since the grid's arrangement might be different for the other person.

First, let's analyze the visual. The top row is empty, which is irrelevant. The middle row has two 'hidden' objects behind red curtains with question marks and an empty square. I don’t know what's behind them. The bottom row has two objects: one is highlighted as the target. The target is a grey striped circle with a red border, and the other object is a grey striped circle with a blue border.

Now, my task is to isolate the target object. I need to describe it in such a way that the listener can differentiate it from the other visible object and, crucially, do so without guessing about the hidden objects. Since I only see the visible objects, my description must be based on those.

The key feature here seems to be the color of the border. Both visible circles have grey vertical stripes, but one has a red border, and the other has a blue border. I need to emphasize that difference.

Let's brainstorm a few options: ""There is a circle with vertical grey stripes and a red border."" ""The circle with the red border."" ""Select the striped circle that has a red outline."" All of these are valid, and my goal is to choose the most concise and descriptive.

I need to make sure my description is robust. Even if one of the hidden objects *is* another circle with a red border, as the instructions say, I don't know that. Therefore, I need to focus on what *I* see.

So, the optimal description would be: **""The circle with vertical stripes has a red border.""** This description clearly identifies the target object and emphasizes the differentiating feature: the red border. It is precise, concise, and doesn't rely on spatial location.
"
exp2_008.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,"triangle, triangular",blue,stripe,"3,1",The object filled with vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the task is clear: I need to describe this object so someone else can identify it. It’s like a visual puzzle, a reference game.  Let's break it down methodically.

First, I need to *analyze* the image. I see a 3x3 grid, though not all cells are filled.  I see a bunch of shapes – a square with a green border and wavy fill, a square with a red border and wavy fill, a blue-bordered star with a wavy fill, a green-bordered circle with a wavy fill. The **target** is a triangle, highlighted. It has a blue border and grey, vertical stripes within it.

Next, I need to **identify unique features**. The target is a triangle, and the vertical stripes are the key.  I’ve got to pick out what distinguishes it from all the *other* shapes in the image. I need to ignore spatial location like ""top right,"" as the rules forbid that. I need to be *sure* to describe it, even if there are hidden elements. The prompt mentions this ""hidden object"" concern, which raises a flag to be extra specific, in case the listener's perspective is incomplete.

Let’s consider the distractions.  There is a green-bordered square, a red-bordered square, a blue-bordered star, and a green-bordered circle. All the distractor objects share a wavy pattern, but not the triangle.

Now, let's **formulate a description**. I need something that will clearly differentiate the target.  The shape is a triangle. The color of the border is blue, but so is the star's. The fill pattern is vertical stripes. This is unique! The grey fill is shared with all other shapes. So, ""the object with vertical stripes"" or ""the triangle with vertical stripes"" looks promising.

I need to **consider constraints**.  I can't use spatial locations.  I should assume that all that *I* see is also *all* the other person sees. But, I should still be careful with the description, just in case. I need to be more precise than ""the triangle"", but I don't want to get too wordy either.

Now, let's **draft possible descriptions**.  ""It's the triangle."" Simple, but risky if there's a hidden triangle. ""It's the object with vertical stripes.""  This is pretty good! It's unambiguous based on what I can see. ""It's the blue triangle.""  This could work. ""It's the blue object with vertical stripes."" A bit long, but clear. ""It's the triangle with vertical stripes."" This is my favorite so far.

Now I need to **select the best description**. What's the most salient, unique feature? The fill pattern! Every other shape has a wavy pattern.  The target has stripes.  That's a very clear, robust distinction. But, the shape is also unique: it's the *only* triangle. Combining shape and stripes is the safest bet: ""The triangle with vertical stripes."" That's very robust, no matter what. ""The blue triangle"" is also robust. ""The object with blue borders and vertical stripes"" is also robust. So let me evaluate the trade-off.

The stripes *feel* more distinctive because they're the *only* straight lines in the image, contrasting with the four wavy patterns.

Let's also be sure to consider simplicity. ""The object filled with vertical stripes."" is also very robust. What if there is a red circle with vertical stripes? Hmm, I should consider a combination of features. Shape + fill seems safest: ""The triangle with vertical stripes."" It avoids ambiguity.

What's the best approach? ""The triangle with vertical stripes."" ""The object filled with vertical stripes."" Both robust.

Let's re-evaluate all the target's features. Shape: unique as a triangle. Pattern: vertical stripes, unique. Border color: blue, not unique as shared with the star. The efficient approach uses unique features.

Let's put it all together to be concise and accurate. ""The object filled with vertical stripes."" Or ""The triangle with vertical stripes.""

The prompt says I'm the speaker, so I just give the description. I will select the *unique* pattern. ""The object filled with vertical stripes."" This is simple, clear, and unambiguous. It focuses on the most salient difference.
"
exp2_009.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,"circle, circular",red,"wavy, zigzag","1,1",It's the circle with the red border and the grey and white wavy lines inside.,"**My Thought Process for the Reference Game**

Okay, here's the situation: I need to describe a target object in a 3x2 grid so someone else can pick it out, and I don't get to see what's hidden behind the curtains. My primary goal is unambiguous identification, focusing on features that make this target *unique*.

First, I'm breaking down the visual information. I see a 3x2 grid, with some cells empty, some occupied by objects, and some obscured by the question mark curtains. The target is clearly marked in the top-left cell—a red dashed box.

Next, I'm cataloging the target's features. It's a circle. It has a red border. Inside, there's a pattern of horizontal grey and white wavy lines. These are my primary descriptors.

I also observe the other visible object: another circle in the bottom right cell. This one has a black border, and a dotted grey pattern against a light grey background. This is a critical point of contrast.

Now, the unknown. I'm aware that two cells are hidden behind red curtains. I *can't* see them, so I must formulate a description that ideally differentiates my target from whatever might be concealed. Since I don't have access to this information, I need to focus on the features of the object in front of me. I'll need to rely on the visible features of the objects in front of me to make a distinction from these hidden objects.

The key is to create a *referring expression* – a phrase that uniquely identifies the target. I'm considering:

1.  **Start with salient features:** The target is a circle with a pattern, so this gives me a good start.
2.  **Differentiate the target from the other visible object:** The target has a red border. The other object has a black border. This is an obvious differentiator! Similarly, the target has a wavy grey and white pattern, whereas the other object has a dotted grey pattern.
3.  **Account for the hidden items:** The hidden objects could be anything: circles, squares, or something else entirely. Since I can't know what they are, I'll have to rely on my best and most robust description. I'll describe the visible object in terms of its unique features. If there are other circles, the red border will distinguish. If there are other patterns, the wavy line pattern will differentiate.
4.  **Construct multiple potential utterances** ""The target is a circle with a red border."" This is a strong feature. The other visible circle has a black border. If there are no other circles with red borders behind the curtains, this is sufficient. ""Inside the circle, there are grey and white wavy lines."" This describes the internal pattern. The other visible circle has dots. This is another strong distinguishing feature.

I'm aiming for concise clarity. ""The circle with the red border"" is the bare minimum, but maybe not strong enough on its own. The description of the pattern, ""wavy pattern,"" is also good. Combining, ""It's the circle with the red border and the wavy line pattern inside,"" is a good start.

I'm thinking about ambiguity. Is there a scenario where this could be misunderstood? The dot pattern and black border of the other object help me; my description easily differentiates the target. What about the unknown items? I need to build a description that considers all possibilities.

Therefore, the final utterance draft is: ""Select the circle that has a red border and contains a grey and white wavy line pattern."" I'm also considering a more natural expression: ""The circle with the red border and wavy lines inside.""

This description should be clear, concise, and robust. It's built on salient and distinguishing features: the color of the border (red) and the pattern type (wavy lines) and colors (grey and white).
"
exp2_010.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,square,red,stripe,"3,2","The object is a square with a red border, filled with vertical grey stripes.","**My Thought Process for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My goal is to describe a specific object in an image so someone else can pick it out. Let's break this down.

First, I need to *understand* what's in the image. I see a 3x3 grid. Some cells are blank, some have objects. Top-left: red circle with grey dots. Top-middle and middle-left: hidden objects, red curtains with question marks (I can't see what's behind the curtains, just the question marks). Middle-right: That's the target! It's a square with a red border, filled with vertical grey and white stripes. I also see a dashed red line around the object. This is a crucial element for me to know which object I am talking about.

Now, I've got to *identify* the target precisely. It's the square in the middle row, third column. Solid red border. Vertical stripes inside. The stripes alternate, grey and something lighter.

Next, I need to consider the *distractors* – the red circle with grey dots and the curtains. The curtains are ""hidden,"" so they're not a factor in my *initial* description. I need to focus on what I *can* see.

So, I must *formulate* a clear description. I can't rely on spatial positions like ""on the right"" since the other person might see a different layout. I need to focus on the target's *visual properties*: the shape, the border, the pattern, and the colors. The key features are: *square, red border, vertical stripes, grey and white stripes.*

Time to *compare* the target to the visible distractor. The circle has no vertical stripes. Good. It has a red border, but that's not enough to distinguish them. So, the combination of ""square"" and ""stripes"" is unique. As for the curtains, I need to be as clear as possible.

Okay, let's *draft* a few descriptions. ""It's a square with a red border."" Okay, but what if something behind a curtain is also a square? Then ""It's the object with vertical stripes,"" - This is a distinctive pattern. Combining features is probably safest, right? I could say ""Select the square with the red border that is filled with vertical grey and white stripes."" or ""The square with vertical grey stripes."" Shorter. It gets the point across. The ""white"" might be implied by the background, and the other person can work with the information ""grey stripes"". ""The object is a square with a red border, and it has vertical grey stripes inside."" That's good. Or ""The target is the square filled with vertical stripes."" Focusing on the shape and stripes. The circle is dots so this is probably fine. Let's refine. ""The square with vertical grey stripes."" That might be sufficient, since the border color is shared with the circle, but the shape and internal pattern are different.

My final *check*: Does it rely on location? No. Does it accurately describe the target? Yes. Does it distinguish the target from the circle? Yes (square vs. circle, stripes vs. dots). Is it concise? Pretty much. The longer version is better.

So, the definitive description: ""The object is a square with a red border, and inside it are vertical grey and white stripes."" It's specific and unambiguous. Shorter version: ""The square with vertical grey stripes."" Probably sufficient. I'm going with the more detailed one to ensure I'm clear. ""It's a square with a red border, and it's filled with vertical grey stripes."" This is what I will use!
"
exp2_011.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,square,black,"wavy, zigzag","1,3",The square with the gray and white wavy pattern.,"**My Analysis of the Reference Game**

Okay, so I'm the ""speaker"" here, tasked with helping someone else, the ""listener,"" identify a specific object in a grid. I have to describe the *target* object, which is indicated by that red dashed box. I'm operating under a few key constraints: I can't use spatial terms tied to *my* arrangement of the grid, and I don't know what's behind the red curtain. The listener *does* know, which is crucial.

First, I need to understand what's visible. I see four visible elements. There are two question mark curtains, a square with vertical stripes, and the target object, which is a square with what appears to be a wavy or zigzag pattern, outlined in black, and a grey and white coloring. Okay, so I know I have a solid, distinctive target. There is also a square with vertical stripes that could cause confusion.

I need to focus on what makes the target unique. The most obvious, distinguishing feature is that pattern: it's *wavy*. That immediately sets it apart from the striped square. Considering what's behind the curtains, however, the wavy pattern seems to be a key element to make sure it is distinct.

I’m thinking “wavy” is my key descriptive term. Now I need to refine the description to be robust. “Wavy lines” seems good. “Wavy pattern” works too. ""Wavy grey and white pattern"" is even better, as the visible striped one is also grey and white. I could also mention the black border, but the pattern is more salient.

I want to be clear and concise. Is ""the square with the wavy grey and white pattern"" too much? Probably not, it's pretty clear. And it's also clear that I could say, ""The square with the wavy lines"" or, ""the one with the wavy pattern."" The pattern makes it the most distinguishable, but a color also helps to differentiate.

So the best is: ""The square with the wavy grey and white pattern."" This covers the key features, shape, pattern, and color, that sets it apart from the other visible, non-curtain element. It should be a safe and effective description.
"
exp2_012.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,"triangle, triangular",black,"wavy, zigzag","2,3",The object is a triangle with a wavy pattern inside.,"**My Analysis of the Reference Game**

Okay, so I'm presented with a reference game. My task is to clearly describe a target object so a listener can pick it out from a set of distractors. My expert eye immediately starts deconstructing the problem.

First, I need to pinpoint the target, and I see it's a triangle, highlighted with a red dashed box. It has a thick black outline and a grey and white wavy horizontal line pattern inside. The challenge is to describe it such that the listener can identify it without using its location.

Next, I need to analyze the other objects: a circle with a red dotted pattern, a circle with a green dotted pattern, a circle with red vertical stripes, and a star with the same wavy line pattern as the target triangle. The star is the closest distractor, as it shares the fill pattern.

Now, I'm formulating my strategy: identifying a property of the target that separates it from all the others. Since I can't use location, I must rely on intrinsic properties.

I begin comparing: The most obvious distinction is the *shape*. It's a triangle. The circles are... circles. This makes the triangle stand out. The wavy line pattern is shared with the star, so the most efficient approach must specify the shape.

I consider a few options: ""It's the triangle."" Simple and direct, but could the listener be *too* quick? ""It's the shape with wavy lines that is a triangle."" This is accurate. ""It's the triangle with a black outline and a wavy pattern inside."" Very descriptive, but potentially verbose.

I analyze the objects and realize the shape 'triangle' is unique amongst all objects. Therefore, ""the triangle"" is perfectly valid. However, since the star shares the wavy pattern, I might be better off adding some extra information. So, ""the triangle with a wavy pattern.""

I’ve conducted a full audit to check my description. Does it rely on spatial location? No. Is it ambiguous? No, there's only one triangle. Is it concise? Yes, very.

Ultimately, I'm choosing ""the triangle with the wavy pattern."" It's simple, unambiguous, and leverages a unique feature (the shape) while confirming the shared feature (the pattern). It should be perfectly clear.

exp2_013.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,2,square,red,dot,"3,2",The square object that is filled with gray dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object clearly enough that someone else can pinpoint it. I'm seeing a 3x3 grid, and there are three objects arranged in a right column. The dashed red box highlights the target - that's my focus.

First, I need to break down the visual components. The top-right cell shows a circle with a checkerboard pattern and a red border. The middle-right cell, the *target*, is a square with a dotted (grey dots on white) pattern and a red border. The bottom-right cell presents a square with a checkerboard pattern and a thick black border.

Now, I'll identify key features of the target object: its square shape, the internal dotted pattern, and the red border. I need to keep those in mind as important features. The dotted pattern is the most notable. Also, I need to remember what the other objects look like to ensure I can distinguish between the target and any distractions.

Let's do a comparison. The first distractor is a circle with a checkerboard and a red border. Right away, the shapes are different: square vs. circle. The patterns are also clearly distinguishable. Both have the same border color, which is less helpful. The second distractor is a square, but the pattern is a checkerboard, and the border is black. This is helpful. Both the borders and the patterns are different.

My goal is to find features that unequivocally separate the target. The internal pattern, the dots versus the checkerboard, is the most clear-cut distinction. The square versus circle shape is also a strong distinguisher. The red vs. black border is also useful.

Now, let's craft a description. I want to be concise but also precise. I need to avoid using any spatial location information (like ""middle-right""). ""The object with the dotted pattern"" or ""the dotted object"" will work. But to make things easier, how about adding shape? ""The square with dots."" It's unique to that object. Or, “The object that has a red border and grey dots.” or “It’s the square filled with grey dots.”

I should consider the prompt's instruction about hidden objects and spatial locations. There aren't any hidden objects in this instance, and my descriptions avoid spatial references, so that's good.

So, let me synthesize this. I could say ""the object with the dotted pattern."" To add clarity, how about ""the square with the grey dots."" This description is unambiguous - there is only one square filled with dots. There is another square, but it has a checkerboard pattern. The combination of shape and pattern is unique.

Okay, I'll go with ""The square object that is filled with gray dots."" That is clear and unambiguous.

exp2_014.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,star,red,checker,"3,2",The star with the checkerboard pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game. My task is to describe this object so someone else can pick it out. The target is highlighted by a red, dashed box. Let's see...

First, I need to *really* look at this image. It's a 3x3 grid. The target's in the middle-right cell. It's a star, and there are a few other objects to take into account.

Here's my breakdown:

1.  **Analyze the Image:** I see a few different shapes: circle, square, triangle and two stars. Each has a different pattern inside, and a border. I need to note all of this.
2.  **Identify Target:** The target is a star with a red border and a checkerboard pattern.
3.  **Analyze Other Objects (Distractors):** The circle has a wavy pattern and a black border. The square has a checkerboard pattern with a black border. The triangle has vertical stripes and a green border. And there's another star. It has vertical stripes and a black border.
4.  **Formulate a Description:** Now, I need to come up with a description that's *unambiguous*. I want to make sure I pinpoint the target.
    *   I see two stars. One is striped with a black border, the other is the checkerboard, red border object.
    *   There are two checkerboard patterns. One is on the square, one is on the star.

5.  **Drafting Descriptions:** Okay, here's where I start brainstorming, trying out various descriptions, evaluating their strengths.

    *   ""It's a star."" - Too vague. There's another star!
    *   ""It's the red object."" - Yes, but let me check if anything else is red, no. Okay, this could work.
    *   ""It's the checkerboard object."" - This is still too vague. There's also the square.
    *   ""It's the star with the checkerboard pattern."" - This is good. It's a very specific description. It combines shape and pattern, so the listener can easily separate it from the square with the checkerboard pattern. It is the best choice so far.
    *   ""It's the star with the red outline."" - this also seems viable as the other star has a black outline.

6.  **Comparing Drafts:** I can see which options are concise, precise, and most likely to work.
    *   ""The star with the checkerboard pattern.""
    *   ""The star with the red outline.""
    *   Both appear sufficient.

7.  **Final Choice of Description:** I'm going to choose the description that forces the listener to use both shape and pattern information. ""Select the star that has a checkerboard pattern inside,"" or, ""There are two stars. Select the one with the checkerboard pattern inside"" or ""There are two objects with a checkerboard pattern. Select the one that is a star"". My strongest thought process is that the pattern is crucial as it is shared with another object (the square), and forces the listener to account for the shape (distinguishing it from the square), and also the shape, it forces the listener to account for pattern and colour. But I'm going to go for the simplest solution.

    *   I can state ""It's a star with a red outline and a checkerboard pattern inside.""

    *   Or go for the most concise approach: **""The star with the checkerboard pattern.""** - This is perfect. It works!

exp2_015.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,"triangle, triangular",green,dot,"3,2",The triangle that is filled with grey dots.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, here's how I'm thinking through this reference game. My primary goal is to provide the clearest, most unambiguous description of the target object so the listener, who sees the entire grid, can easily identify it.

First, I need to understand the visual context. I've got a 3x2 grid of visible cells, with two hidden cells. I can see four objects in total: the target triangle with a green border and grey dots, another triangle with a blue border and a checkerboard pattern, two white empty cells and two hidden objects behind red curtains (those are a wild card – I have no information about what's behind them, but the listener does).

My strategy revolves around distinguishing the target object from the visible distractors. I'm focusing on intrinsic properties of the target, avoiding any spatial references, since the arrangement might change for the listener. 

I'm zeroing in on the target: it's a triangle, it has a green border, and it is filled with a pattern of grey dots. The other visible triangle has a blue border and a checkerboard pattern. The empty cells are trivial distractors.

To formulate my description, I'm considering using either the border color (""the triangle with the green border"") or the inner pattern (""the triangle filled with grey dots"" or ""the polka-dotted triangle""). Combining both features (""The green-bordered triangle with grey dots inside."") is also an option.

The key is to be precise. ""Polka-dotted"" might be more memorable and easily understood. Now, I have to consider whether any feature is redundant. Is the color sufficient to make the object unique? Or the pattern?

Let's focus on the salient features. Compared to the other triangle, the dot pattern is quite distinct, so using the pattern as a descriptor should do the job. The final decision is down to either: ""The triangle that's filled with grey dots."" or ""The triangle with grey dots inside.""

Ultimately, the listener can see all objects, including the hidden ones. So, a simple, clear, and unambiguous description is best. Given the choice, the pattern, which is more fundamental to the target's appearance, is a strong distinguisher.

Let's imagine the listener. They see two triangles, one with dots, the other with a checkerboard. That means that describing the dot-filled triangle is sufficient to make it clear.
"
exp2_016.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,square,green,dot,"2,3",The square with the polka dot pattern.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object clearly and concisely so someone can identify it. I'm given an image with a 3x3 grid, showing three objects. I need to focus on the highlighted target. The target is a green-bordered square with a grey polka dot pattern, positioned at the bottom-middle. I have to avoid spatial references like ""bottom-middle"" because the listener might see it differently.

First, I analyze the objects. I see a square (target), and two circles. The target's the only square – that's a key distinguishing feature. The border colors are green (target), blue, and red. The inside patterns are a grey wavy line, a grey polka dot, and the grey polka dot (target). I need to generate descriptions that are unambiguous.

I consider several possible descriptions. Initially, I think of ""the square"". Then I think of ""the object with a green border"". Both are good because they use unique features. Next, I consider combining features: ""the green square"" or ""the square with polka dots"". The pattern alone (""the one with polka dots"") isn't enough because another object (a circle) also has it. The square shape, and the green color are unique, and very strong features. I decide that a good strategy is the most primary characteristic, the shape. So ""The square object"" is a good option. I can also use two unique features ""The green square"".

I then step back to evaluate. I have the target (green square with polka dots), the blue circle with wavy lines, and the red circle with polka dots. My focus is on the unique features. The square shape and the green border are the most distinct. The pattern is shared by the red circle.

I'm thinking about the most robust description. Considering potential colorblindness in my listener, relying solely on color might be risky. Shape is a safer bet. Therefore, I refine the previous description to emphasize the shape as the most salient property. ""The square"". I could also say ""The object with the green border"". Or I can use a combined approach ""The green square"". Or I can use ""The square with a polka dot pattern"". This would distinguish the object from the others.

I could be verbose and say ""The object is a square with a green border and a grey polka dot pattern"" but that's too much detail. Conciseness is key to effectiveness.

Ultimately, I have three solid options:
1.  The square.
2.  The object with the green border.
3. The square with polka dots.

I decide to use two features ""The square with polka dots"" or ""The green square"", to ensure there's no room for confusion. Since this uses two unique features, it should be the most effective. I will choose ""The square with polka dots"".
"
exp2_017.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,4,star,green,stripe,"2,3",The green star.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, here's how I'm approaching this reference game. The goal is to clearly and unambiguously guide someone to select the correct object.

First, I need to analyze the scene. I see a 3x3 grid. The target object is a green star filled with vertical grey and white stripes, located in the bottom-center cell. There are other objects: a red curtain with question marks, a blue-bordered circle with grey and white stripes, two black-bordered squares (one with dots, one with a wavy pattern).

My priority is identifying unique features. The shape (star) and the color (green) are immediately striking. The stripe pattern is shared by the circle, but it's still a distinguishing detail. The unknown content behind the curtain is a wildcard. I *have* to assume there might be something similar back there.

So, I start building descriptions. ""The green star"" jumps out as concise and specific. ""The star with vertical stripes"" is also an option. I also consider other phrases, but they don't seem as unique, due to the presence of an object with the same pattern. The phrase ""The green object"" could be a problem if there's another green object, or a star, hiding behind the curtain. ""The green object with vertical stripes"" is also a consideration.

I need a description that's robust against these hidden possibilities. I'm thinking, is the term ""star"" unique enough? Yes. Is the color green unique enough? Yes. That combo is the key. Combining ""green"" and ""star"" means, statistically, I'm likely to get a match.

""The green star"" is the most efficient and the safest bet. It's concise and combines two unique visible features. Even with an unseen object behind the curtain, the chances of *another green star* are low.

To be extra careful, if needed, I could mention the stripes, but let's stick with simplicity. ""The green star"" it is. I could also add more detail to confirm the vertical stripes inside of the star: ""The green star with the vertical stripes inside.""

Therefore, my final description is going to be ""The green star."" Simple, direct, and unambiguous, given what I can see. This should be clear enough, and even if other details are hidden, I can explain it.
"
exp2_018.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,star,blue,dot,"1,1",It's the star with the blue outline that's filled with grey dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the highlighted target object so the listener can pick it out. I'm seeing a dashed red box around it, so it's a five-pointed star.

First, I'm identifying the key features. It's a star. The star has a blue outline. Inside the star, there are grey dots on a white or light grey background. It's located in the top-left cell of the grid.

Now I need to analyze the distractions. There's a square with a blue border in the middle-right cell. It contains a pattern of grey wavy lines on a white background. I can't see what's behind the two red curtains with question marks, but I have to assume the listener has access to this information.

I need a description that *uniquely* identifies the target. ""It's a star,"" is too basic. It's likely that it could be more than one star. The best approach is to be as specific as possible. Adding the outline color helps, so ""It's a star with a blue outline"" is an improvement. But I need to add that internal pattern: ""It's a star with a blue outline and grey dots inside.""

Comparing this to the visible distractor (the square), I see they both have blue outlines and a similar grey pattern, but the shape and internal pattern are different. The distractor is a square with wavy lines. The key is to emphasize the *differences*.

I can refine the description. ""The star with the blue outline and grey dots."" or ""The blue-outlined star that has grey dots inside."" I have to resist mentioning the location, since I'm not supposed to.

I can make it even clearer: ""Select the object that is a star with a blue border and filled with grey dots."" This is extremely precise, but it might be too verbose.

Before I commit to a description, I'm doing a final check: Is it unique *among the visible* objects? Yes. I need to account for what could be *behind* the curtains. The description's specificity should reduce the chance of ambiguity with a hidden object. For example, if I only described a ""blue object,"" there could be multiple. But describing ""the star with the grey dots"" is likely to be unique. The combination of shape (star) and pattern (dots) is pretty strong.

So, I'll go with a concise and direct description: ""The star with grey dots inside."" It highlights the key features that set it apart: shape (star) and the internal pattern (dots). This should be unambiguous!

exp2_019.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,"triangle, triangular",red,dot,"2,1",Select the triangle that is filled with dots.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is clear: describe the target object so my partner can select it from the grid. This is about efficient and unambiguous communication. Let's break this down systematically.

First, the scene. It's a 3x3 grid. Some cells are empty, some have objects. Two cells have mystery objects hidden behind red curtains; I don't know what's there, but my partner does. My challenge is to overcome that uncertainty by accurately describing the *visible* elements. I can see two objects, the primary triangle with dots and a triangle with wavy lines.

The target itself is a triangle in the top-middle position, and it's marked with a red dashed box. It has a red border and is filled with a pattern of grey dots on a white background. The most prominent distractor is another triangle with a blue border and grey wavy lines in the bottom right corner. Then there are the hidden objects – a wildcard I have to account for indirectly.

My first step is identifying the key distinguishing features. The primary difference is immediately apparent: the dot pattern in the target versus the wavy lines in the other triangle. The border color is also a distinct feature: red for the target, blue for the distractor.

I need to craft a description that uniquely identifies the target. I can use the border color (""triangle with a red border"") or the internal pattern (""triangle with dots""). Combining them (""triangle with the red border and filled with dots"") could offer more robustness.

However, the hidden objects add complexity. I have to assume my partner can distinguish them based on the visual information I provide. If I say ""triangle with dots,"" there might be another dotted triangle hidden. So, I have to be specific about what *I* can see. The dot pattern is the most distinct visual cue in this case. The wavy lines of the other object also seem very different to the dots, from my vantage.

My refined thinking tells me a concise description is key. ""The triangle filled with dots"" is clear and unambiguous *relative to the other visible object*. I could add specificity: ""The triangle with gray dots,"" or emphasize the pattern: ""the triangle with the dot pattern"". ""The triangle with a red outline"" also works.

Considering all this, my final answer has to be a simple, efficient description which is unambiguous based on the visible objects. Even with the hidden object, it has to be the most distinct feature of what I can see. So, I'll go with ""Select the triangle that is filled with dots."" I feel confident that this will allow my partner to uniquely identify the intended target.

exp2_020.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,"triangle, triangular",black,dot,"1,1","The object is a triangle with a black outline, filled with a pattern of grey polka dots.","**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm in a reference game. The user wants me to be the speaker, and my objective is to guide someone else to identify the target object. It's a 3x3 grid, and I can see the top-left cell with a red dashed box, that's my focus. I know this grid is split between what I can see and what the listener can see, meaning there's some asymmetry in information. The listener, importantly, can see behind the red question marks. I can only use what I observe to guide the user.

First, I need to break down what's visible. I'm seeing a triangle, and it's outlined in black. Inside this triangle is a pattern. It looks like a grid of small grey dots – a polka dot pattern. The cell's background is white. I need to contrast this.

There are other things I can see that are useful for creating a distinction. There's a square with wavy grey and white horizontal lines, and another triangle with vertical grey and white stripes. I need to distinguish my target from these.

Now, I think about the hidden objects. The red curtains are in the listener's view. I don't know what's behind them, but the listener does. This is critical. The description must be specific enough to eliminate every other object, *including* the hidden ones.

How do I do this? Well, start simple. It's a triangle. That's a first and obvious distinction. Then, the key is the pattern. The target triangle has a grey polka dot pattern inside. The other visible triangle has vertical stripes. Easy.

So, the first formulation is: ""Select the triangle that is filled with grey polka dots"". But I want to make it even stronger. Is ""polka dots"" the best term? ""Small grey dots"" might be more precise. But ""polka dots"" is common and concise. So, I keep it. Color is important, they are grey dots. The outline is there on all triangles, but it won't distinguish.

Am I being ambiguous? Could one of the hidden objects also be a triangle with grey dots? It's possible, but I can only describe what I *see*. The game assumes a unique target. The best strategy is to be as precise as possible about what is visible. The unique combination of shape and pattern is what matters.

So, to recap the strategy: identify the shape (triangle), identify the internal pattern (grey polka dots). Then, combine those two into a single, unambiguous phrase. Avoid any spatial language like ""top-left"" or ""next to"" since the listener's view might be different.

Ultimately, the best description will be, ""The triangle with grey polka dots inside."" It's clear, concise, and should be enough to distinguish it from the visible objects. Now, let's see if that works.

exp2_021.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,"triangle, triangular",red,stripe,"1,2",The object is a triangle with a red outline and vertical stripes inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the goal is clear: I need to describe the object within the red box in a way that allows someone else to select it from a set of distractors, without using spatial references. This is a reference game, and I need to be precise. Let's analyze.

First, I'll break down the target object. It's a triangle. The outline is red, and the inside has vertical grey stripes. Good, that's the base information.

Now, the other objects are crucial distractors. I need to understand them fully to formulate a distinguishing description. There's a blue circle with a grey and white checkerboard pattern, a green star with grey polka dots, and a red star with vertical grey stripes. Hmm, that red star... it's a potential source of confusion because of the stripes and color.

I'm thinking about how to build my description effectively. The core strategy here is *uniqueness*.  What features are unique to the target triangle, and which are shared? Shape is the most obvious differentiator. There's only *one* triangle. Red outline and vertical stripes? Not unique, since the star shares either of those.

So, I can start with the most specific term: ""triangle.""  ""The triangle"" should be immediately clear. But I could strengthen the description to mitigate potential confusion.  Adding the color or pattern could make it less cognitively intensive for the listener.

I'm evaluating my options for the descriptions:

*   ""The triangle"" - Simple, but is it *too* simple?
*   ""The red triangle"" - Unique, and adds more detail.
*   ""The triangle with vertical stripes"" - Also good, but maybe less immediate.
*   ""The red object with vertical stripes"" - *No!* That's ambiguous. It could refer to the target or the star.

I need to confirm the uniqueness again. ""Is there another triangle? No. Is there a red object with vertical stripes? Yes, a star.""  So shape is the key. My description needs to communicate ""triangle"" directly. The others are just extra.

Therefore, the best option is a clear and complete description: ""It's the triangle with the red outline and vertical stripes."" This is unambiguous and includes all necessary information to reduce the listener's cognitive burden. It's clear, robust, and concise.

Finally, I'm ready to respond with a clear and concise description that focuses on shape, as it is the critical differentiator.
"
exp2_022.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,square,black,stripe,"3,1",It's the square with vertical stripes.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to guide the listener to the target object. I need to be precise, efficient, and, above all, unambiguous in my description, considering the listener will select the target object based on my description. I need to take a few steps to achieve this.

First, I need to meticulously analyze the target object. It's a square with a black outline and vertical grey stripes. I have the benefit of knowing its position in the array (top row, rightmost cell), but spatial references are off-limits, so I need to ignore that piece of information. I also see it has a red dashed box, but that is only for me.

Next, I need to analyze all the other objects, the distractors. I’ve identified a star, a circle, another circle, and another star. I need to understand how the target object is different from all the other objects, in order to describe it effectively. I also know there are no hidden objects to worry about. The text mentions them, but I'll ignore that, as it is not shown.

Now, I'll formulate a description. The most obvious, and promising, starting point is the shape: it's a square. Crucially, there's only *one* square present. Therefore, ""the square"" is a description that alone uniquely identifies the target. However, to be extra clear, I should also consider the other features. The target has a black outline. There is one other object with a black outline, a circle. The target also has vertical grey stripes. There are two other objects with vertical grey stripes (the circles).

I need to combine these features to create a robust description. ""The square with vertical stripes"" or ""The square with a black outline"" are also very good and unique. I want to compare the target to similar distractors, so I'll also compare it to the most similar distractors, which are the circles. They share a black outline and vertical stripes. The shape is the only difference.

Efficiency is important, so “the square” is a strong contender. But, in this conversational setup, I also have to consider clarity. ""The square with vertical grey stripes"" is probably best. Or ""The square with the black outline"".

I'll lean towards the simplest description, but I'll test it to ensure clarity. I will start by focusing on the unique shape, but I'll add fill pattern or outline color to ensure this strategy is bulletproof. I can also try phrases like ""Select the square"" or ""The one I'm thinking of is the square"", keeping a conversational tone in mind.

Finally, I'll combine the unique shape with a non-unique feature, as this is a good strategy in reference games. I'll focus on both features to be extra clear.

Therefore, my final description will be, ""The object is a square and it is filled with vertical stripes."" - It is a concise, accurate, and unambiguous description. I believe this description will uniquely identify the object.
"
exp2_023.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,"circle, circular",green,dot,"3,2",The circle filled with grey dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the task is clear: I need to describe a target object in an image so that someone else can identify it. This is a reference game, so precision is key. First, I need to understand the image layout. It's a 3x3 grid, and a dashed red box highlights my target. It's a circle, with a green outline, and filled with grey dots.

Next, I'll identify the other objects to use as distractors. There's a triangle, a square, a star, all filled with grey dots, and another circle but with a blue outline and a grey and white checkerboard pattern. The rest of the grid cells are empty.

Now, I'll formulate a description. Shape: it's a circle. Outline color: green. Fill pattern: grey dots. I need to find a unique description. Simply saying ""the circle"" is useless since there are two. Likewise, ""the object with grey dots"" won't work either. However, ""the circle with the green outline"" or ""the green circle"" work, as does ""the circle filled with grey dots."" The other circle has a blue outline, and the star is green.

Let's pick the most concise and effective description. ""The circle with the green outline"" is clear. ""The green circle"" is also perfectly fine and more concise. ""The circle filled with grey dots"" is also a solid option. I'm avoiding positional descriptions, so I have to rely on inherent features.

I need to make sure my description is foolproof. Both the green circle and the circle filled with grey dots are good. Since there is only one other green object, a star, I am likely to use a description that combines color and shape.

""The green circle"" is probably the most concise and unambiguous. It uniquely identifies the target, as the other green object is a star, and the other circle is blue.

I could also be more descriptive, adding the grey dots, but that's unnecessary. So, I need to test that one, to make sure it is correct.
- Is it a circle? Yes.
- Is it green? Yes, the outline is.
- Are there any other green circles? No.

""The green circle"" works. ""The circle filled with dots"" also works.

Considering the fill pattern as the difference between the circles, ""The circle filled with grey dots"" is a good description.

I am reevaluating. The salient feature between the two circles is their fill pattern and their outline color. I could say ""the green circle,"" or ""the circle filled with dots."" All are unique, the dot fill directly describes a visual element of the target, and distinguishes it from the checkerboard pattern. Therefore, I will choose ""the circle filled with grey dots"" for the final description.
"
exp2_024.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,2,"triangle, triangular",green,stripe,"1,2",Select the green triangle.,"**My Reasoning for Object Description**

Okay, here's how I'm approaching this reference game. The user wants me to act as a speaker, and my goal is to describe a specific object in a visual scene (a 3x3 grid) so that someone else can identify it. I need to be precise and avoid ambiguity.

First, I analyze the image. It's a grid with three visible objects: a green circle with wavy lines, the target object (a green triangle with vertical stripes - marked with a red box), and a black triangle with dots. The other cells are empty. There are no hidden objects or complexities.

Next, I zero in on the target, which is that green triangle with vertical stripes in the middle-left cell. My task is to formulate a description that uniquely identifies it.

Now, I look at the distractors. I'm thinking, what differentiates the target from the other objects? The obvious features are shape, outline color, and fill pattern. I consider each feature, comparing the target to the distractors. ""The green object"" is ambiguous as there is both a green circle and the target. Similarly, ""The triangle"" is ambiguous as there are two triangles. So I need to combine features to uniquely identify it.

I consider the comparisons: the green outline is shared with the circle, so I can't just say, ""the green object."" But if I say ""the green triangle,"" that works. The other triangle is black. Alternatively, ""the triangle with the vertical stripes"" also works, as that feature distinguishes it from the triangle with dots and the circle with wavy lines. So, I see that I can use a combination of properties to successfully identify it.

I'm thinking, ""the green triangle"" is the most concise description. But I'm also considering the other options: ""The triangle with the vertical stripes"". Another option might be ""The green object with vertical stripes"". This is clear, concise, and avoids any ambiguity. It uses multiple features to create a unique identifier.

I want a description that's both direct and unambiguous, and I want to be safe, especially given that the layout may change. I need to avoid location-based descriptions. So, I decide on ""the green triangle."" It's simple, clear, and uses both color and shape – common descriptive elements. The listener only has to find a triangle and look at the color to find the target.

I also confirm that both descriptions work. ""Select the green triangle."" or ""Select the triangle filled with vertical lines."" Both should work.

Finally, I finalize the most succinct and clear option. ""Select the triangle that has a green outline."" That's the most minimal and the most efficient instruction.

exp2_025.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,star,blue,dot,"1,3",Select the star with the blue outline that is filled with grey dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game. My objective is to describe the target object clearly enough that someone else can pick it out. I'm given an image that I need to analyze.

1.  **Image Analysis:** I've got a 3x3 grid here. The top row has a red curtain covering the first two cells with two question marks. The third cell is empty. The middle row is entirely empty. The bottom row presents the relevant objects. The first cell is the target: a star with a blue outline and a fill of grey dots. It's marked with a red dashed box, but that's for me – the speaker – only. The second cell is empty and the third cell is a checkerboard pattern with a blue border.

2.  **Target Identification:** The target, which I can ""see,"" is clearly the star inside the red dashed box.

3.  **Object Description: The Star** I need to define the star. It's a five-pointed star shape. The star has a blue outline, and it's filled with a pattern of grey dots. The cell holding it has a red dashed border for me. But I'm going to only describe the object and I'm not going to describe the box around the star, since that is for me.

4.  **Other Object Identification:** There is also a checkerboard pattern with a blue border visible. The objects behind the curtain aren't visible to me but the person selecting can ""see"" all the objects.

5.  **Description Formulation:** I can't rely on location terms like ""bottom left"" since the arrangement is variable. I need to focus on visual properties. My initial thought is just ""the star."" But what if there's another star? ""Select the star with the blue outline."" is better. Adding ""filled with grey dots"" makes it even more specific.

6.  **Description Development:** I went through some draft descriptions: ""Select the star."" might be simple but ambiguous. ""Select the star with the blue outline."" is better. ""Select the star filled with grey dots."" also works. Combining them: ""Select the star with a blue outline that is filled with grey dots"" is quite robust.

7.  **Comparison and Differentiation:** The goal is to distinguish the target from other visible objects, especially the checkerboard. I need to anticipate and differentiate this object.

8.  **Refinement:** I'm refining the description for clarity. I can't simply say ""the object is a star,"" I need to add that it has a blue outline, and inside it are many small grey dots. But I am told to only describe the target object.

9.  **Final Choice:** After the initial draft, I am now going to select the most salient features. It has a star shape, a blue outline, and the interior is filled with dots. The checkerboard has a blue border too, so I can't just say ""the object with the blue outline."" I need to be more specific. I considered and rejected a bunch of drafts. ""Select the star with a blue outline that is filled with grey dots"" seems safe. Or a more natural phrasing: ""It's the star with the blue outline and the grey dots inside.""

Ultimately, the most concise and robust option is: ""Select the star with the blue outline and grey dots inside."" This should unambiguously identify the target.

exp2_026.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,star,black,checker,"1,1",The object is a star with a grey and white checkerboard pattern inside.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Star**

Okay, here's the situation: I need to describe a specific object, a star, so that someone else can pick it out from a set. I'm imagining I'm in a reference game, where the goal is clear, and I have to be precise. It's the star in the red box.

First, I need to really *see* the target. It's in the top left cell of a 3x3 grid. It's a five-pointed star. The outline is thick and black. Now for the crucial detail: *inside* the star, there's a pattern. It's a checkerboard, but not a stark black and white; it's alternating grey and white squares.

Next, I need to consider what else is visible. There's another star in the bottom left cell. That one also has a thick black outline, but its interior pattern is completely different. It has vertical grey and white stripes. I should note that there are two cells with red curtains and white question marks. My collaborator will see those. The rest of the grid is empty.

Now comes the tricky part: formulating a description that is *unambiguous*. I can't just say ""the top star"" because that relies on location, and I'm told to avoid ""degenerate spatial locations"". The key difference lies in the interior pattern. How can I best communicate that?

I started with some basic options and refined them: ""It's a star"" – too vague, there are two. ""It's the star with a pattern inside"" – still not good enough; both stars have a pattern. This leads me to: ""It's the star with the checkerboard pattern."" Ah, that's better! This clearly distinguishes it from the striped one. The ""grey and white checkerboard"" might be more accurate, but ""checkerboard"" is probably sufficient.

The main idea is that the description must be specific enough to work even if something else is hidden. So, I need to rely on the salient features of the object. My description is: ""The object is a star with a checkerboard pattern inside.""

I checked to make sure it avoids location and that it *should* work with the other object in view. I think it accounts for the hidden objects, too, because I'm describing the most distinguishing visible feature. If it's ambiguous, the listener will let me know!
"
exp2_027.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,star,blue,checker,"1,3",It's a star with a blue outline and a checkerboard pattern inside.,"**My Analysis of the Reference Game**

Okay, so I'm acting as the speaker in a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object within this 3x3 grid, and I need to do it in a way that allows the listener to identify it unambiguously. It's a classic problem, really.

First, I need to break down the image. I have a 3x3 grid, a few objects in play. The target is immediately obvious: the star in the bottom-left, highlighted by that red dashed box. I see a triangle with a red border and grey dots, and two red curtains each sporting a white question mark. I know the curtains are ""hidden,"" meaning the listener knows what's behind them, but I don't. That's a key constraint – I have to rely only on the information I can see, which is the shapes, patterns and colors.

Now, let's nail down what the target actually *is*. It's a five-pointed star. It has a blue outline. Inside, there's a grey and white checkerboard pattern. That's the core. Next, I need to figure out the best way to describe this to make sure I don't confuse anyone.

I've got to distinguish this star from the other visible object: the triangle. The shape is the most obvious difference. But I should probably add more, to cover my bases. The checkerboard pattern inside the star is pretty unique, and the blue outline is also distinctive.

I started thinking about possible descriptions: ""It's a star,"" is too simplistic. ""It's a blue star with a checkerboard pattern inside,"" feels better. ""The object is a star with a blue border and a grey and white checkerboard pattern in the middle"" is even more detailed, but is this level of detail necessary?

I'm making sure I don't use spatial terms to describe the target, so no ""bottom-left"" or anything like that. I'm focusing on the visible characteristics, because I can't know what's hidden behind the curtains, so I need to avoid making assumptions or referring to things I can't see.

I have to think about conciseness and clarity. The listener might be presented with other stars in the other hidden areas. So I have to be specific enough to eliminate other possible stars. ""The star with the blue outline"" is pretty good. ""The star with the checkerboard pattern"" is also really good. I can probably combine the two to be even safer.

So, I've ended up with a few options, but have landed on something simple but precise: ""It's a star with a blue border and a grey and white checkerboard pattern on the inside."" This is good, right? It's unambiguous, it avoids spatial references, and it utilizes multiple features to guarantee identification. I think a more concise version would work just fine as well: ""The star with the blue outline and a checkerboard pattern"" seems like a perfectly adequate way to make sure there's no confusion. That's the best option here.

exp2_028.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,"triangle, triangular",blue,dot,"1,1",The blue triangle.,"**My Analysis of the Reference Game**

Okay, so I'm being asked to play the role of a speaker in a reference game. My objective is clear: describe a target object in an image to allow someone else to correctly identify it. This image is a 3x3 grid, and I need to come up with a description that's precise enough to pick out the target from the distractors.

First, I need to analyze the scene. There are four shapes within the grid: a blue-outlined triangle filled with grey dots (that’s the target, indicated by the dashed red box), a black-outlined square filled with grey dots, a green-outlined triangle filled with grey dots, and a black-outlined star also filled with grey dots. I note that the image instructions mentioned ""red curtains with question marks,"" but they're absent here, so I'll keep that instruction in mind for future instances, just in case.

Now, let's identify that target specifically. It's a triangle. It has a blue outline, and it's filled with grey dots. Simple enough.

Next, the distractors. I’ve got to quickly analyze these to see what separates the target: there's a black-outlined square, a green-outlined triangle, and a black-outlined star, all with grey dots inside. Comparing them to the target, the critical features seem to be shape and outline color. The fill (grey dots) is common to all, so that won’t help with disambiguation in this case.

Okay, time to form a referring expression. Since there’s another triangle in the scene, ""the triangle"" is too vague. The blue outline, however, is unique to the target. So, ""the blue shape"" would work. But, combining shape and color will give me the clearest description, I can use ""the blue triangle"", which is the clearest combination. I could say ""the triangle with the blue outline"", or ""the blue triangle filled with grey dots"". However, the fill doesn't help me distinguish this case.

Now, refine and check. I'll test ""the blue triangle"" and ""the shape with the blue outline"". Both are concise and unambiguous. I need to make sure I'm not using location-based descriptors because the instructions mention that the objects might be arranged differently for the listener. That's good to keep in mind, but these proposed descriptions are location-independent, so I’m good. The absence of the red curtains means I don't need to consider them.

Finally, the choice is clear. ""The blue triangle"" is the most direct and specific, a strong combination of color and shape. It’s concise and will likely be the quickest path to a successful reference. ""The shape with the blue outline"" works as well. Both are solid solutions!
"
exp2_029.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,"circle, circular",red,"wavy, zigzag","1,3",It's a circle with a red outline and a gray wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the user wants me to act as a speaker in this reference game. My objective is clear: to describe a specific object on the screen in such a way that another person can pick it out, and that person is also an expert. Let's break this down.

First, I need to *analyze* the target. It's in the bottom-left cell of the grid. But I can't rely on spatial location as an absolute descriptor, so that is just a starting reference. Visually, it's a circle with a red outline and grey wavy lines inside.

Next, I need to understand what else is on the canvas. I'm going to look at the distractors. There is a red star with grey wavy lines, a green triangle with a grey and white checkerboard, a blue triangle with grey polka dots, and a black star with grey and white checkerboard. There are also a few empty spaces.

Now, I *identify* what makes the target unique. The most standout feature? It’s the *only* circle. That's key. The red outline is shared with the star, and the grey wavy fill is also shared. So, those features alone are not enough.

Then, I'm going to *formulate descriptions*. The simplest is just ""the circle"". That should be enough, but to reduce any risk of ambiguity, combining features is better. ""The red circle"", ""the circle with wavy lines,"" or even ""the red object with wavy lines that is a circle"" would work. I will compare the features and look for which is most useful.

I *consider constraints*. I know to avoid degenerate spatial descriptions, and the red curtain is irrelevant here, it is not present. I'm ready to describe.

From the listener's perspective, I need to think about how best to *choose* the best description. ""The circle"" is immediately clear, there's no other circle. ""The red object"" or ""the object with wavy lines"" wouldn't do the job because they describe two of the figures. So, leading with the unique shape is best, and combining it with another unique feature like the color is even better.

**The final strategy:** I'm going to start with the shape. I'll make sure to add the color of the outline and pattern for maximum clarity.

So, *the best plan is* to say ""It's a circle with a red outline and a grey wavy pattern inside."" This description is solid. It's direct, specific, and doesn't rely on any ambiguous terms.
"
exp2_030.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,"circle, circular",green,"wavy, zigzag","3,2",Select the circle with a green outline and a wavy pattern inside.,"**My Reasoning for Object Identification**

Okay, the goal is to describe a target object in a way that allows someone to pick it out from a set, even with potential hidden elements. I'm focusing on features of the target object itself, avoiding any reference to its location in a grid or layout. I need to be precise, as there are hidden objects that could potentially complicate things.

First, I analyzed the visual context: a 3x3 grid with some empty cells and some filled with objects. I identified the visible objects by their shape, outline color, and fill pattern, comparing them with the target. My mind is instantly working towards features that uniquely identify this target. The target is a circle with a green outline and a grey-and-white wavy fill pattern.

I started by looking at individual features: it's a circle, but there's another. It has a green outline, and the other circle has blue. So ""the green circle"" distinguishes it, but what if there's a *hidden* green circle? Hmm. Similarly, the wavy pattern is unique among the visible objects, but there could be hidden objects, too.

To be robust, I combined features. The combination is what I'm looking for. ""The green circle with a wavy pattern."" I checked to see if it's completely unambiguous amongst *everything* in the scene, both visible and potentially invisible. I thought through several ways to say it.

*   ""Select the green circle."" Simple, potentially risky.
*   ""Select the circle with a wavy pattern."" Potentially ambiguous.
*   ""Select the circle that has a green outline and is filled with a wavy pattern."" This is more precise, but verbose.

My preference is for conciseness as long as it doesn't sacrifice clarity. I settled on combining the features to make a more solid description: ""Select the green circle with the wavy pattern."" This is what I came up with. I'm satisfied that this is a robust and unambiguous description.
"
exp2_031.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,"circle, circular",green,checker,"2,1",The object is a circle with a green outline and a checkerboard pattern inside.,"**My Analysis of the Reference Game**

Okay, so I'm being asked to describe an object within this image – effectively playing a reference game. My primary goal is to provide enough information that the other person can uniquely identify the target object. The image is a 3x3 grid, though some cells are merged, so it's really a 3-row, 3-column grid, and some objects span multiple cells.

First, I need to break down what I'm seeing: there are three visible areas. One is clearly marked with a red dashed box, the target. It's a circle in the top center cell with a green outline and a grey and white checkerboard pattern inside. Next, there's a green-outlined triangle with a grey and white wavy line pattern. Finally, there's a red curtain with white question marks, occupying two cells at the bottom, which is hiding something or multiple things. I *don't* know what's behind the curtain.

Now, I'll identify the target specifically. It's the circle. It has a green outline, and the internal pattern is a grey and white checkerboard. That's the core.

Next step: I need to consider distractors, which means understanding how the target differs from *everything else* in the image. The triangle is the most obvious, so let's compare those: the target is a circle, and the triangle is, well, a triangle. The checkerboard pattern inside the circle contrasts against the wavy lines inside the triangle. Also, both shapes have a green outline. The question marks and the curtain suggest hidden objects that could be anything. Therefore, my description needs to be very specific to account for these unknown objects.

The key is in creating a description that's *unambiguous*, regardless of what is behind the curtain. I want to avoid using positional language like ""top center"" – the other person might see a different arrangement.

So, I'm thinking, what's essential? Circle, green outline, and checkerboard pattern. Those are strong. I need to make sure the properties described rule out any other object in the grid, visible or not.

I'm thinking of ""The circle with a checkerboard pattern."" It's concise. If the person has to select amongst multiple shapes, simply saying ""the circle"" may be insufficient; but, if the context is known and unambiguous, it might be sufficient. Is the triangle's pattern checkerboard? No. Is it possible there's another checkerboard object behind the curtain? Yes.

To be extra safe, I want to include the green outline, since it's a prominent feature. ""The circle with a green outline and a checkerboard pattern inside."" That seems robust. I'll include shape, color, and pattern. That description clearly distinguishes the target from the triangle, and it's also unlikely (though not impossible) that there's *another* green circle with a checkerboard pattern behind the curtain.

Ultimately, I want to be concise and accurate. The essential combination that distinguishes the circle from the triangle is the shape and pattern. The color adds detail. Therefore I am going to select:

**Utterance: ""The circle with a green outline and a checkerboard pattern inside.""**
"
exp2_032.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,4,"triangle, triangular",red,stripe,"3,3","It's a triangle with a red outline, filled with vertical stripes.","**Analyzing the Target Object for Effective Description**

Okay, so I'm being asked to play a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object – the one highlighted with the dashed red box – in a way that another person can identify it correctly. I can see a 3x3 grid, but some cells are hidden behind red question mark curtains. Critically, I don't know what's behind those curtains, while the listener does. I need to formulate my description carefully to avoid ambiguity. I can't rely on spatial references, so ""bottom right"" is out.

Let's begin by cataloging the visible objects: Top-left: a blue-outlined star with a wavy grey/white pattern; Top-center: a red curtain; Top-right: a blue-outlined circle with a grey/white checkerboard pattern; Middle-left, middle-center, and middle-right are empty; Bottom-left: a red curtain; Bottom-center: a green-outlined circle with grey/white vertical stripes; and finally, the target: a red-outlined triangle with grey/white vertical stripes.

My focus is the target: a red-outlined triangle with vertical stripes.

Let's break down the target's properties: It's a triangle, it has a red outline, and the interior is filled with vertical stripes.

Now, I'll compare it to the visible distractors to identify unique features. The blue star has a blue outline and wavy lines. The blue circle has a blue outline and a checkerboard pattern. The green circle has a green outline and vertical stripes.

Comparing, the triangle shape and the red outline are unique among the visible objects. The vertical stripes, however, are also present in the green circle. This means I can use ""triangle"" and ""red outline"" as good descriptors, but ""vertical stripes"" alone might not be sufficient.

The main challenge is the unknown hidden objects behind the curtains. Could there be another triangle? Another red object? Another object with vertical stripes? I need to build a description that is robust to these possibilities.

Considering those scenarios, I'm thinking:
*   ""The red triangle"" is concise and relies on two unique visible features.
*   ""The triangle with vertical stripes"" could be good, but shares one feature (vertical stripes) with another visible object.
*   ""The red object with vertical stripes"" is also good, but potentially redundant.

Therefore, ""The red triangle"" seems like a solid choice and most likely the *most* succinct. But in this situation, I'll go with ""Select the triangle with the red outline."" as the most robust. ""The object is a triangle with a red outline"" is also great. The color is unique, making it a key attribute. The vertical stripes are shared, and the listener is aware of other possibilities. I'll go with the more definitive description: ""Select the triangle with the red outline.""
"
exp2_033.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,star,green,stripe,"3,3",The object filled with vertical stripes.,"**My Utterance Strategy**

Okay, here's the game. I need to guide someone to identify a target object in a 3x3 grid, describing it without relying on spatial location because the grid might be different for them. The target is in a dashed-red-box. I've got a specific task: to deliver a clear, unambiguous description.

First, I need to understand the visual context: There's a 3x3 grid with four visible objects: a circle with a green border and checkerboard pattern, a square with a black border and dot pattern, a triangle with a blue border and dot pattern, and the target—a star with a green border and vertical stripes. No red curtains or question marks that were mentioned, so that is not the case for this image.

Next, I need to focus on identifying the target. It's a star with vertical stripes and a green outline. I can see the distractors too: they are a green-bordered circle with a checkerboard, a black-bordered square with dots, and a blue-bordered triangle with dots.

The goal is a description that makes the target uniquely identifiable. Using the shape is a strong starting point: it's a star, and there's only one. Adding features is ideal for robustness: it has vertical stripes. ""Star"" is the most direct approach. ""Vertical stripes"" is another. ""Green border"" is not unique since the circle has the same.

Let's weigh the options. I could say, ""The star,"" but what if there's another star out of my view? I could say, ""The green star with vertical stripes,"" but since the ""green"" is a commonality with the circle, it might not be the best starting point. The vertical stripes are unique. This is more salient than the color of the outline. ""The object filled with vertical stripes."" Seems like the winning solution, as it highlights its most unique feature. It's also concise. ""The star with vertical stripes"" is also a strong candidate. But I'll stick with the pattern description.

Final choice? **""The object filled with vertical stripes.""** This description should be accurate, efficient, and most importantly, unambiguous. It directly targets the unique visual pattern, which helps me be precise and reduce any potential for error. This feels like the best strategy here.

exp2_034.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,square,red,dot,"1,3",Select the square that is filled with grey dots and does not have a thick black border.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the descriptor in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to guide someone else to identify the target object. It seems to be a 3x3 grid, a visual puzzle. I need to distill its essence into a clear description, avoiding any ambiguity.

First, I need to analyze the field. I see a grid. The target is immediately apparent: it's the square in the bottom-left corner, marked by this dashed red box, which I understand is just an indicator for *me* and not part of the actual object. I need to describe it so the other player can locate it.

Let's break down the visible objects. There are squares, circles, question marks hidden behind curtains, and empty squares. It's the square with grey dots that I need to focus on.

So, the target is a square, filled with a grid of grey dots. That's a good starting point, but not sufficient. There's another square with grey dots up top. That's a crucial point. We must differentiate. The other square has a clear, solid black border. My target *doesn't* appear to have a border (apart from the dashed red line which is irrelevant for the description, I must remember). 

I'm thinking: how can I describe this square *uniquely*? Let's rule out the other squares and circles. 

Here are a few formulations I'm considering. They should be clear and concise.

*   ""It's a square with grey dots inside."" (Ambiguous, there are two.)
*   ""It's the square with grey dots and no black border."" (Precise, but perhaps not the most visually descriptive.)
*   ""It's the square filled with a grid of grey dots, without the thick black outline."" (Better, emphasizes the visual distinction).

I need to avoid the location (""bottom-left"") as it's an instruction. Also, I must not mention the red dashed box.

I've carefully considered the visual features: the square shape, the grey dots inside, and, most critically, the presence or absence of a defining feature—the black border of the other dotted square. The absence of this border is the key distinguishing factor here.

So, my final check confirms this. The description zeros in on the visual properties and specifically the *absence* of the black border. It's unambiguous and distinct. The other player should be able to identify this square using this description.
"
exp2_035.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,star,black,dot,"3,2",The star with the black outline.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game, and my goal is to describe a target object in such a way that another person can identify it from a set of possible options. I'm given an image which appears to be a 3x3 grid. I'm seeing this grid, but the other person presumably sees the entire thing. The situation is complicated because some of the objects are hidden behind a red curtain with question marks. That means I need to be *really* careful and specific with my description because I can't be sure what other objects might be present in the full picture. My goal is for the other person to understand which object I want them to select with minimal possible ambiguity.

First, I analyzed the image. The target is a black star with a dotted pattern inside, located in the middle-right cell. There's also a green star with a dotted pattern in the top-right cell. The others are empty or covered. The presence of the red curtain means there are *unknown* distractor items. These unknown items are my main concern because my description must be sufficient to distinguish the target even with the unknown objects.

My first thought is to directly identify the target's color. ""The black star"". This seems simple, but is it *sufficient*? I have to consider the potential hidden objects. What if one of the hidden objects is *also* a black star? If that's the case, ""the black star"" is useless.

I quickly rule out mentioning its location because this game's intent is to isolate the description from positional cues. So, I have to find a way to distinguish the target based on its visual properties, even if those properties don't exist in the grid. ""Black star with a dotted pattern inside"" is a bit more descriptive, but I realize the green star *also* has a dotted pattern. So, the dots don't help differentiate.

The key feature is the *outline* color. I realize the star isn't *solid* black. It has a black *outline*. ""The star with the black outline"" is a pretty good descriptor, and this is what distinguishes it from the green star, and is very accurate.

I considered other features such as the shape, but I then realize it is also a five-pointed star like the other star in the grid. What I should do is select the most direct feature to describe the image I have. I am limited to the information I can perceive, so I have to work with that.

I go through various iterations of the description, weighing conciseness versus precision. ""The black star"" is concise, but ""the star with the black outline"" is more accurate because of its focus on the distinguishing feature. Finally, I confirm that the goal is to make a description in order for another person to understand the image.

The final utterance should be: ""The star with the black outline"".

exp2_036.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,star,green,dot,"2,1",It's the star with the green outline and a polka dot pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the goal is clear: I need to describe this object so someone can pick it out from the grid, without using spatial references – a classic reference game. First, I'm analyzing the image. It's a 3x3 grid with various shapes. The target is highlighted – a star.

I'm identifying the key features. The target is a star, with a green outline and a grey polka dot fill on a white background. Now, I have to consider the distractors. There's a star with a blue outline and a striped fill. There's a circle with a checkerboard fill, and triangles with checkerboard fills, one red outline and the other one green. Other cells are empty.

The constraints are important; no spatial cues, and no hidden objects in this instance. Now, I have to formulate a description. Shape alone (""the star"") won't cut it, there's another. Color is a good starting point, so ""the green star"" is potentially good, but there's a green triangle. Fill pattern is also important. So, the ""polka dot"" fill is unique. Combining features is best for clarity.

Let's check for confusion. Is the color unique? Yes, it is unique as there is only one green star. Is the shape unique? Yes, the target is a star, but there are two different star objects, and so more descriptors are needed. Is the fill pattern unique? Yes, no other object shares a polka dot pattern.

I'm drafting utterances now. ""The star with the polka dots."" That's concise and unambiguous. ""The green star"" is also unique, but more general. ""The star that has a green outline and is filled with gray polka dots"" is extremely descriptive. I'm leaning toward efficiency and clarity. The fill pattern (polka dots) is absolutely unique. So, it is clear.

I have two strong options: ""The star with the polka dots"" and ""The green star"". The polka dots feel like the most robust descriptor. Let me combine both: ""The green star with the polka dot pattern inside."" or ""The star with the polka dot fill.""

Let's refine it a bit for conversationality. Is there another star with the same characteristics? No. It's the only one with dots. I can combine a unique shape and unique fill pattern for the most clarity:

**The star with the polka dot pattern inside.**

That nails the shape (star), and the distinguishing feature (the polka dot fill). That covers both the shape and the unique fill pattern, implicitly differentiating it from all the others. The polka dot pattern is the most salient feature, so let's stick with that. **Final utterance: ""It's the star with the polka dot pattern inside.""**

Okay, so I'm being asked to play a reference game. I need to describe a specific object in this 3x3 grid so that another person can identify it correctly. I'm focusing on the task.

First, I need to *really* look at the image. Let's see... it's a 3x3 grid, and some squares are empty. The target is in the top-left square, indicated by the red dashed box (but I'm not supposed to mention that part, obviously). Right, the target is a triangle. It has a distinctive grey and white wavy pattern inside and a thick black border. There's also a red curtain with a question mark, and a checkerboard pattern with a red border. The rest are empty white squares.

Now, let's identify what makes the target unique. It’s definitely the triangle with the wavy pattern. That internal pattern is key to distinguishing it from the checkerboard. The black border is also a good distinguishing factor, setting it apart from the checkerboard's red border. Since I can’t see what's behind the curtains, I need to focus on what I *can* see. The shape is a triangle.

Next, I'm thinking about how to describe it. I need to be concise but unambiguous. ""It's a triangle"" is a start, but that's too simple. Is anything else a triangle? Not that I can see. ""It's the triangle with wavy lines inside"" is better and adds the crucial differentiating pattern. ""It has a black border"" is a good differentiator. I'm going to create a very clear description. ""Select the triangle that has a black border and a wavy pattern inside"" seems very clear and unambiguous.

I need to refine this a bit. Shorter is generally better. How about ""The triangle with the wavy pattern?"" Or, ""The object I'm referring to is a triangle with a wavy pattern inside.""

I want the most effective description: ""The triangle with a wavy pattern inside.""
This is a good, concise description. The other visible object is a square with a checkerboard pattern, making this description unique enough. The shape (triangle) is unique among visible objects. The pattern (wavy) is unique. The border (black) is unique compared to the checkerboard's red border. I think it should be sufficient. I'm confident with this description.

exp2_038.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,"circle, circular",red,stripe,"3,3","The object is a circle with a red outline, filled with vertical grey and white stripes.","**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with a reference game. My objective is to guide someone to identify a specific object within a visual grid, and I need to do so *without ambiguity*. I'm given an image which is a 3x3 grid, and I need to hone in on the object in the bottom right cell, which is highlighted by a dashed red box. The objects in this grid will act as the set from which I must define this target.

First, I need to analyze the elements I can see. I identify the target object – a circle with a red outline, containing vertical grey and white stripes. I've also noted other visible objects or ""distractors."" I see a square with a grey and white checkerboard pattern within a green border, and two identical red curtains, each with a white question mark. The curtains are ""hidden"" in this game; the listener can see behind them, but I cannot.

My immediate instinct is to start by focusing on the fundamental attributes: shape and internal pattern are the first that come to mind. I need a description that *uniquely* identifies the target. Initially, I considered ""The object is a circle"" -- but that is too broad, I need more detail. The checkerboard is a square. So, good start. I can also look at the internal pattern: stripes and a checkerboard are distinct.

I must also consider those hidden objects. The key is to be specific enough that even if the objects behind the curtains share some attributes with the target, they can still be clearly differentiated. If one is also a circle, I need to add more detail. If one has stripes, it adds more.

I start to formulate a description, working my way from the general to the specific. My first refinement is ""The circle has vertical stripes."" This is good, because it's a shape and pattern and the other obvious object is a square. But, I decide to be thorough. I add, ""The circle has a red outline and vertical grey and white stripes inside."" Is this too precise? Maybe, but it eliminates any potential ambiguity.

I weigh brevity against clarity. What's the most *essential* feature to distinguish the target? The most general unique feature? The pattern. I then focus: ""The object is a circle filled with vertical stripes."" Still, I also consider, is ""the circle with vertical stripes"" sufficient? The square and the rectangles have very different shapes.

I then check. Does my description lean on location? No. Does it account for hidden objects (implicitly, by aiming for extreme specificity)? Yes. Is it clear and easy to understand? Absolutely.

Finally, I weigh my two descriptions: ""Select the circle with vertical stripes"" versus ""The object is a circle with vertical stripes."" I consider ""The circle has grey and white vertical stripes inside"" as my final option, as I will assume that the listener can resolve ambiguity, and I've given the most prominent features. The vertical stripes vs the checkerboard pattern seems the most important distinguishing factor. So ""The object is a circle with vertical stripes,"" then ""It's the circle filled with gray and white vertical stripes."" It's concise and descriptive of shape and pattern. I can use this.

exp2_039.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,"triangle, triangular",blue,"wavy, zigzag","3,1","It's a triangle with a blue border, and inside it has a gray wavy pattern.","**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My goal is to describe a specific object so someone else can identify it, but they don't see the same setup as I do. Specifically, there's a dashed red box around the object I'm supposed to describe, which they *don't* see. I need to give a good enough description, such that they can pick it out. Importantly, some objects are hidden, so I can't be sure if my description will work.

Let's break this down. First, I need to know *what* I'm describing. Right, the target object is a triangle with a blue border, and it has a wavy gray pattern inside. Got it. Now, what can I see? Hmm, I see a square with a blue border and a gray dot grid, a circle with a green border and a wavy gray pattern, the target triangle, and another triangle with a blue border but a gray dot pattern. There are also two hidden objects behind red curtains.

So, I need to build a description that is *unambiguous* among what *I* can see, but is still generally good. The others might look at the hidden objects, so I cannot guess.

*   **Initial thought:** Okay, ""a triangle"" would work, but wait - there's another triangle! So, that's not enough. ""A triangle with a blue border""? Nope, still not enough, because the other triangle has a blue border too. ""A triangle with a wavy pattern""? Okay, there is a wavy pattern on another object (the circle), but the circle has a different border.

*   **Refinement:** ""A triangle with a blue border and a wavy gray pattern."" This should be sufficient. Let's make sure. The square has a blue border but a dot pattern. The circle has the wavy pattern but is green. The other triangle has a blue border, but a dot pattern. Yes! This description is *unique* among all the visible objects.

*   **Considering hidden objects:** Is there a *chance* that one of the hidden objects is also ""a triangle with a blue border and a wavy gray pattern""? Maybe, but I don't know and I can't guess. The most I can do is give a good description among the visible shapes. So, I will proceed with this description.

*   **Phrasing it:** Let's make it natural: ""The object is a triangle with a blue outline, filled with a wavy gray pattern."" That has all the key aspects: shape, border, and pattern. That should be pretty clear, and concise.

I've got it: ""The object is a triangle with a blue outline, filled with a wavy gray pattern.""

exp2_040.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,square,blue,stripe,"1,3",The square filled with vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process on Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game, and my goal is to make it easy for someone to pick out a specific object from a set of distractors. Here's what I'm thinking:

First, I need to *really* analyze the target. It's a square, a blue border, and vertical grey stripes filling it. I also noticed that the target is highlighted by a red dashed box, but I am not to use this. I must use only the visual features of the object itself.

Now, let's look at the other objects to see what makes this one unique. There's a circle with green border, another with the blue, a triangle with a blue border, a triangle with a green one, and several empty cells. There are 2 shapes (square and triangle) that are colored blue, and 2 that are green. Both the circle and the square have vertical grey stripes.

My approach: find something that *uniquely* identifies the target.

I'll start with the most obvious feature: the shape. There's only *one* square. Easy. ""The square."" That's the most efficient description, and it's guaranteed to work. It's a strong feature.

But, I should still check the other features to make sure it is a truly unique identification.

Next, I consider the border color and the fill pattern. There are multiple objects with vertical stripes, and multiple with blue borders, so on their own, these don't uniquely identify the target. I consider combinations: ""The square with vertical stripes."" Seems unique.

I check this against the distractors. ""The square with vertical stripes"" is unique because nothing else shares *both* of those features.

Okay, let's explore this further. ""The object is a square,"" is a good start. I can be more specific, but it's probably enough. I'll mentally evaluate the options for a more complete description:

*   ""The square,"" is concise but might be too simple, even if it is the only square.
*   ""The square with vertical stripes,"" this is better. It's safe.
*   ""The blue square,"" works well.

My goal: a description that's *unambiguous* and *efficient*. I want to be *sure* the listener gets it, but I don't want to make it overly wordy.

I'm thinking from the listener's perspective. If I just say ""the square,"" they'll find it instantly. Adding the stripes might just be a little extra assurance.

I could say, ""Select the square"" - direct and effective.

I need to compare the features. Does describing the vertical stripes or the blue border uniquely identify the object? No, because other objects share these features. Thus, the shape is the most important feature.

The key feature is ""square.""

So, I think the *best* description, the one that balances clarity and brevity, is ""The square with vertical stripes."" It's specific enough to remove any doubt. This will make it easy and efficient to identify the target object. It clearly identifies the target. It distinguishes it from the two circles that are also filled with vertical stripes.

exp2_041.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,"circle, circular",red,dot,"3,1",It's the circle with the red outline that is filled with grey dots.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, here's how I'm approaching this reference game. The user wants me to be a speaker, aiming to help someone else pinpoint a specific object. My task is to describe the target object, which is currently hidden within a 3x3 grid, a game of visual deduction as it were. I need to make the description precise and unambiguous.

First, I've got to analyze the entire grid. I see nine cells. Some are blank. Some contain objects. Two of those objects, the question mark curtains, are currently out of reach for my description, since I have no information about what's behind them. There are also two objects that are circles containing a grid of grey dots.

Now, my attention snaps to the object enclosed in the dashed red box. *That's* the target. It's one of the circles with grey dots, but this one has a red outline. The other has a black one. These circles, and the difference in their outlines, are going to be key.

My next step is to identify what else I need to distinguish my target from, the distractors. I see the other grey-dot circle, the question mark curtains, and empty squares.

To formulate a successful description, I have to be succinct, and avoid any potentially confusing spatial language. I quickly consider the crucial feature: the outline. I need to clearly differentiate the target from its closest distractor – the other circle with grey dots. I'm focusing on that color difference.

I start formulating, and reject some first drafts. ""It's a circle with grey dots inside"" is way too ambiguous. ""It's the circle with a red border"" is much better. ""It's a circle filled with a pattern of grey dots, and it has a red outline"" is very specific.

I realize the key is to be clear, but still concise.

I'm gravitating towards ""The circle filled with grey dots that has a red outline."" or ""It's the circle with the red border.""

I do a final check. No location references, and the description should uniquely identify the target. It does. The other circle has a *black* border. The curtains are different objects. The empty squares are different. This should work.

exp2_042.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,"circle, circular",red,"wavy, zigzag","3,3",The object is a circle with a wavy pattern inside and a red border.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game and need to describe a target object (the one inside the red dashed box) so another person can pick it out from a set of distractors. First, I have to *understand* what the target object is. It's a circle with a red border and a grey wavy pattern inside. It's in the bottom right cell. I need to be careful to avoid using spatial locations, however.

Next, I need to analyze the distractors. There's a star with a red border and a grey vertical stripe pattern, a square with a black border and a grey wavy pattern, and a star with a black border and a grey polka dot pattern. The remaining cells are empty.

Now, I'm forming a description. Let's break down the properties: shape, border color, and inner pattern. ""Circle"" is *unique*. There are no other circles. ""Red border"" is not unique, as the star in the top middle also has a red border. ""Wavy pattern"" is also not unique; the square in the top right has a wavy pattern too.

I could say, ""The circle,"" which is sufficient because there's only one. Adding more details would be good for clarity though. I could say, ""The object with a red border and a wavy pattern."" This combination *is* unique because no other object shares both those features, unlike saying just ""wavy pattern."" Or I could say ""the red shape that isn't a star."" That is unique as well.

My goal is to be concise but still leave no ambiguity. Since it's a reference game, I need to be as specific as possible. What if there's a hidden object? I should be thorough.

So, here's what I'm thinking: The target is a circle with a red border and a grey wavy pattern inside. Looking at the distractors, that description is unique. The star is a different shape and pattern, the square is a different shape and has a black border, and the other star has a different shape, color and pattern.

""The object is a circle with a red border and a grey wavy pattern inside."" That should be good. It is the shortest, clearest, and most descriptive way to identify the target. I'll stick with that. Let me look for any redundancies and further refine it. ""The circle with the wavy pattern."" That still works. However, the instructions mentioned that hidden objects are possible and to be as specific as possible. So, I will stick with the initial description: ""The object is a circle with a red border and a grey wavy pattern inside.""
"
exp2_043.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,star,green,"wavy, zigzag","1,1",Select the star with the wavy pattern inside.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the speaker in a reference game. My objective is to guide someone to identify a specific object, highlighted for me, using only words. I'm seeing a 3x3 grid, though some cells are empty, and my target is the green-outlined star with the gray wavy-line pattern.

My initial thought is a systematic analysis. First, I mentally inventory the objects: the target star, another star, a red triangle, a red square, and a black circle. I note their shapes, outline colors, and internal patterns. I'm an expert in this, so I'm looking for the most efficient way to achieve my goal.

Now, I'm comparing the target to the distractors, especially the other star, since they share the same base shape. The outline colors are the same. That tells me that a description using only those elements won't work to differentiate the two. Therefore, the key differentiator is the internal pattern: wavy lines versus vertical lines. The red triangle and square can be easily discarded because of their different shapes and colors. The black circle can also be easily discarded because of its different shape and color.

My guiding principle is to be unambiguous, efficient, and avoid spatial references that might be relative to my perspective. I'm thinking, ""Let's start simple. 'Select the star.' No, too vague. 'Select the star with the wavy lines inside.'"" That works! It's concise and precise. I realize that the color is not necessary for disambiguation, but can be added for extra measure.

I consider the possible ambiguities, thinking like a listener. Could the phrase, 'Select the green star with wavy lines inside', cause confusion? No, because only the target has that specific configuration. The pattern is clearly the distinguishing feature.

So, I arrive at the simplest description, ""Select the star with the wavy lines inside."" It is concise, and unambiguous. It immediately identifies the category (star) and then uses the crucial detail (wavy lines) to pinpoint the target. I've also thought about including the color as extra information, so the description becomes ""Select the green star with the wavy pattern inside."" Either one will lead the user to the correct target.

exp2_044.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,square,red,dot,"1,3",It's the square that is filled with grey dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My task is to describe this target object so someone else can pick it out from the grid. Let's break this down.

First, I need to understand the playing field. It's a 3x3 grid, some cells are empty, some have objects, and some are hidden behind curtains. The listener can see what's behind the curtains, but I can't. The target is highlighted, which I can only see.

Now, I've got to zero in on the target. It's in the bottom-left corner and the selection box is dashed red, but that's just a visual aid for me. The object itself is a square with a solid red border, and inside the square is a grid of grey dots. 

I see two other visible objects: a green-bordered circle with grey dots and a green-bordered circle with grey vertical stripes. Now, the hidden objects are in the center left and bottom right. I have to create a description that differentiates the target from the visible objects and hopefully, any hidden ones.

Shape seems like a great place to start, as the other objects are circles, and the target is a square. So, a square, with a red border. Also, grey dots on the inside.

What makes this target unique? Well, it's the shape – a square, not a circle. It's also the red border versus the green borders of the other visible objects. And the pattern, grey dots, versus grey stripes. Even if there are hidden objects, the shape and the border color are strong features. The prompt says that the listener sees the box. The object is a square with a solid red border. The other objects are green-bordered circles, and the target is a square.

Now, let's think about a concise and accurate description. I want to avoid using location. The description has to be robust enough to work, even if there are hidden objects. 

I could start with the shape. ""It's the square"". That's simple, but is it enough if there is another square behind a curtain? No, I need to add more information.

""The object with the red border"" relies on color. Is that enough? If there's another red object hidden, no.

Okay, let's combine. ""It's the square with the red border"". That combines shape and color. It's concise. Very strong.

Let's incorporate the dot pattern, ""It's the square with the red border with grey dots inside.""

Ultimately, I want to be as clear as possible, and not have the person question which is the correct target. The target is a square filled with grey dots and has a solid red border. I must make a description without making it location-based. The shape and the color of the border should be sufficient. But the dot pattern might be needed, as well.

I'm thinking about the most salient features: square shape versus the circle shape, and the red border versus the green border. ""The square filled with grey dots"" or ""The red-bordered square."" or ""The square with a red border filled with grey dots"". This should be enough. Let's try to make it concise while being descriptive.

""Select the square with dots.""

Or perhaps even stronger, ""The square with the red border"". That seems good, as it takes the shape and color of the border into account. I'll go with this!
"
exp2_045.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,"triangle, triangular",black,stripe,"2,1",The object is a triangle with vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process for Describing the Target**

Okay, the task is to describe a target object in a visual grid so that someone else can identify it. I need to be precise and avoid any ambiguity. I see a 3x3 grid with three objects: a triangle in the top middle, a star in the middle left, and a circle in the middle right. They all have thick black outlines and internal patterns of grey stripes or wavy lines. The target, indicated by the dashed red box (which only I can see), is the triangle with vertical grey stripes.

First, I'll break down the features: shape, pattern, and location. I need to avoid positional descriptions, so ""top-middle"" is out. The triangle and the star share the ""vertical grey stripes"" pattern, but the circle has wavy lines. The key is to find a unique identifier.

I quickly realize that the triangle's shape is the distinguishing factor here; there is no other triangle. The pattern is helpful but not *necessary* for unique identification. It would be efficient to use just the shape. So, the simplest description is ""The triangle."" I could add more detail for extra clarity, like ""The triangle with vertical stripes,"" but that feels a bit redundant. Based on the rules, my goal is to be as concise as possible.

I have to make sure that I don't use the positional information. So, saying ""the top-middle object"" is out. Also, it says to not describe the objects hidden behind the red curtain, so I need to make sure that my description is true regardless of what's behind the curtain.

I'm thinking, ""The triangle."" is the safest bet, as it's the only one. But should I add more detail? ""The triangle with vertical stripes"" could be a little better. What if the person I am talking to cannot see the ""vertical stripes"" pattern, or there are multiple triangles? So, I should be as precise as possible. It is the only triangle on the screen, and the most efficient way to describe it is to simply focus on this unique attribute.

I think back to my goal to be both clear and efficient. ""The triangle"" would work, because it's the only one. But is it clear enough? I should ensure that there is no other triangle. Let's make it a full sentence. ""The object is the triangle"". However, should I add the pattern? So I have ""The triangle with vertical stripes"". This is perfect. Then, I decide that the best approach is to mention both the unique shape and the pattern.

Ultimately, after weighing the options, my final utterance will be: ""The object is a triangle with vertical stripes."" It is precise and unambiguous.
"
exp2_046.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,star,red,"wavy, zigzag","2,1",The star with the red outline.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm in a reference game. My objective is clear: describe the target object so the listener can pinpoint it from a set of distractors. I need to be precise, concise, and avoid any ambiguity, especially as I can't rely on spatial cues like ""top-middle.""

First, I analyzed the target object. It's a star with a red outline and a wavy gray and white fill. I took note of its specific features and mentally flagged them.

Next, I looked at all the distractors to identify potentially confusing elements. I saw a green-outlined triangle with the same wavy fill, a red-outlined triangle with a dotted fill, a black-outlined square with the wavy fill, and a black-outlined star with the wavy fill. There are also four empty cells.

Considering the rules, and most importantly that I can't reference specific locations on a grid, I have to form a description based on visual features. I know I have to be concise, but precise. The listener needs enough information to get it right.

I considered several options. ""The star"" is useless since there is more than one star. ""The red star"" is ambiguous since the red-outlined triangle could be considered ""red"". ""The star with the red outline"" is better. It clearly differentiates the target. The wavy fill doesn't help as a distinguishing feature, since the other star has the same.

Let me review: is there any other object that could be described as a ""star with a red outline""? No. Is there any other star? Yes, but its outline is black. Is there any other object with a red outline? Yes, the triangle. But it's a triangle, not a star. So, by combining ""star"" and ""red outline"" uniquely identifies the target.

I double-checked to confirm the description avoids spatial references and that it is unambiguous. I thought that maybe ""The red-outlined star"" would work. But, I think ""The star with the red outline"" is better because it clearly states the shape.

Therefore, ""The star with the red outline"" is the best description. It is the most precise and unambiguous way to identify the target object. It's also concise.
"
exp2_047.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,square,green,stripe,"1,3",It's the square filled with vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game. My goal is to describe a target object in an image so someone else can pick it out. I need to be as clear and unambiguous as possible. Here's how I'm thinking about it:

First, I need to understand the visual field. It's a 3x3 grid, but some cells are merged. I've identified the main components: a checkerboard circle (top middle), a dotted square (middle left), and my target: a square with vertical grey stripes and a green border (bottom left). There's also a red curtain with question marks (bottom middle and right), which obscures something else. The listener knows what's behind the curtain; I don't.

My core task is to identify and describe the target. I've pinpointed it: the square with the vertical grey stripes and green border. Now, how do I describe it so it's unmistakable?

I need to compare and contrast the target with the distractors. The obvious comparison is with the other visible objects: the checkerboard circle and the dotted square. The object behind the curtain is a wildcard, so I'll describe the target independently of it.

To create a useful description, I have to pick out the most important features. The shape is a square. The pattern is vertical grey stripes, and it has a green border. Compared to the checkerboard circle, it's easy: shape and pattern are completely different. The more relevant comparison is with the dotted square because it is also a green-bordered square. So, the distinguishing feature is the *pattern* - vertical stripes versus grey dots.

To formulate the description, I started with the most unique feature. A simple statement like ""The object is a square with vertical grey stripes"" could do, but it lacks the extra details that might be required. I considered adding the border color, but it doesn't distinguish the target from the other visible square.

I thought about starting with phrases like ""Select the square filled with vertical stripes"", which is also to the point. I also considered adding the border colour like ""The object is a square with a green border and is filled with grey vertical stripes"".

The most important thing is to make it easy for the listener, so I want something concise and efficient. They see everything; I'm just guiding their attention. Keeping in mind the visible items, I concluded that the most effective thing to say is: ""The object is a square filled with vertical stripes."" The pattern is the key differentiator; it quickly separates the target from the circle and the dotted square. That's my final answer!
"
exp2_048.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,square,red,stripe,"3,3",A square with grey vertical stripes and a dashed red outline.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game, and my task is to describe a specific object so the listener can identify it. First, I need to understand what's in front of me. I've got a 3x3 grid with four objects and five empty spaces. The target object is highlighted with a dashed red box – which, as I see it, is a clue for *me*, but it could be misleading in the object description. Let's start breaking down what I see.

First, I identify the objects: a red-outlined star with a wavy gray pattern, a black-outlined circle with gray dots, a blue-outlined square with vertical stripes, and a red-outlined square with vertical stripes. I immediately identify the target – the dashed red box points to the red-outlined square.

Now, I look for key features. I see the target is a square with grey vertical stripes and a red outline. Ah, wait a minute, the red outline itself appears to be *dashed* – not a solid red line with a dashed box *around* it. Interesting. I've got to make sure I don't misinterpret that.

Next, I need to analyze the other objects and look for distinguishing features. The star is unique because of its shape and wavy pattern. The circle stands out because of its shape and dotted pattern. But I have two squares here. The blue-outlined square is the distractor. The solid blue outline is the key difference between the squares. Both squares have grey vertical stripes.

Now, let's compare those squares to isolate the distinguishing features. They both have vertical stripes. The target's outline is red, and the other square has a blue outline. However, as noted before, the target's outline is *dashed*, which is the most unique feature.

I formulate a description that will be unambiguous. The ""a square with grey vertical stripes and a dashed red outline"" sounds pretty good. It references the shape, the pattern within, the outline color, and the outline style.

Let's refine that. ""The square with the dashed red outline"" is concise. ""The object with grey vertical stripes and a dashed red outline"" is good as well. I consider how this description will stand up.

The listener might focus on the red outline, which is shared by the star, but it has a completely different shape. The outline style (dashed vs solid) is key. The star's is solid. Therefore, even saying ""the red square"" won't work in this case. The dashed nature of the target's border is key. The listener sees the same objects, just in a different position.

Let me think about ambiguities: are there any hidden objects? I don't know, so I have to be as descriptive as possible given what I can see. Shape, pattern, and the outline must be described. It all comes down to the border. The target must be distinguished from the other, blue-outlined square. And that border is dashed.

I check it again. ""A square with grey vertical stripes, which has a dashed red outline"" - unambiguous. It separates the target from the other objects in the grid. ""The dashed red outline"" is the most unique feature.

Now, let's re-examine that ""dashed"" property. Did I misread the instructions? The target is *highlighted* with a dashed red box. Is it *separate* from the object? Careful inspection shows the border *itself* is dashed, not a solid line with a dashed box overlaid. So, the description is accurate. The object *is* drawn with a dashed red border, not a solid line that is being highlighted.

Finally, I make my decision. I need a robust description. The key here is the distinction from the blue square. They both are squares and both have grey vertical stripes. The dashed red outline, however, is the differentiator. This makes ""The square with the dashed red outline"" or ""The square with grey vertical stripes and a dashed red outline"" a great, complete description. I'll go with the more complete description because it is safer in case there are hidden objects.

The utterance then: ""A square with grey vertical stripes and a dashed red outline."" That's the best I can do.

exp2_049.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,square,green,stripe,"1,1",The square with the green border.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the goal is clear: describe the target object within this grid so someone else can pick it out. I need to be precise, but also concise. First, I'm analyzing the visual setup. It's a 3x3 grid. The target object, indicated by the dashed red box (though that's just a selection indicator, not part of the *object*), is in the top-left. It's a square with vertical gray and white stripes inside a green border. There are other objects: a star with a green border and a checkerboard pattern, another square with vertical stripes but a black border, and two hidden objects behind red curtains with question marks.

My next step is to nail down the target's features: it's a square shape, striped pattern, with a solid green border. Now, I have to identify potential distractors.  There's another striped square with a black border, and a green-bordered star. Two hidden objects. The challenge is to craft a description that eliminates these distractors.

Simply saying ""the square"" is too vague. ""The striped square"" is also ambiguous because of the other striped square. Similarly, “the green-bordered object” is ambiguous because of the star.

I need to combine features. Let's compare the target to the black-bordered square: the key difference is the border color. ""The square with the green border"" or ""the striped square with the green border"" would work. Comparing to the star, which also has a green border, the differences are shape and pattern.  Thus, ""the square with the green border"" or ""the green-bordered object with vertical stripes"" could work.

Now, I'll synthesize the best description. ""The square with the green border"" seems promising. It distinguishes the target from the star (which isn't a square) and the other square (which is a black border).  I must remember that, for the listener, the hidden objects are relevant. While I can't see them, the listener might know what's there. Could there be another green-bordered square hidden? Yes. Another striped green bordered object? Yes. However, I must work with the objects I *can* see. The best approach is to be specific based on my view. The most obvious differences are the square/star shape and the black/green borders. ""The square with the green border"" successfully incorporates these two crucial distinguishing features.

Let's do a final check.  The description is ""the square with the green border."" Does this point to the target? Yes. Does it eliminate the distractors? The black-bordered square: Yes, its border is black. The green-bordered star: Yes, it's not a square. Is the description concise? Yes, it is. The description is solid, so that's what I'll go with!

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to help the listener identify the object within the dashed red box. As an expert, I know the nuances of effective communication in these scenarios. Therefore, I need to craft a precise and unambiguous description. Here's my thought process:

First, I take a structured approach to the image: I recognize the 3x3 grid layout and identify all visible elements: the two red curtains with question marks, the star, the dotted circle, and the empty cells. The target is, of course, the star in the bottom row's second column.

Next, I zero in on that specific star. I dissect its features, noting its five-pointed shape, the red outline, and the distinctive interior pattern of vertical grey and white stripes. I know that the dashed red box is there, but that I can't directly refer to that.

The key is identifying and differentiating the target object. I'm mindful of the distractors: the curtains, the dotted circle, and the empty spaces. The curtains are red with white question marks. The dotted circle has a green outline and a grey dotted pattern. The empty cells are, well, empty.

So, formulating the description is where the expertise comes in. I'm focusing on features that make the target *unique*. The best way to make it unique is to use shape, outline, and fill. I know to steer clear of spatial language (like ""in the middle"" or ""to the right"") because the listener's arrangement of objects might be different, and I don't want to rely on the shared spatial context. The challenge is to identify something easily describable and clear.

I'm starting by establishing that the target is a star, the most obvious differentiating feature. My goal is to describe it so the listener can *only* identify the target object. Then, I refine: ""a star with a red outline,"" which is better, but maybe not specific enough. Now, I add in the vertical grey and white stripes on the inside of the star.

The final, distilled description? I feel the best option is ""The object is a star with a red outline and vertical stripes inside."" It's concise, precise, and incorporates features that are unlikely to be shared by the other objects, particularly the ones hidden behind the curtains. I'm confident that should be enough for any expert to identify the target. I've accounted for all the nuances, I think this should be a winning description.

exp2_051.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,"triangle, triangular",black,"wavy, zigzag","2,3",Select the triangle with a thick black outline that is filled with grey wavy lines.,"**My Thought Process: Deciding on the Best Description**

Okay, the goal is to clearly identify a target object in a reference game. I need to describe it so the listener can pick it out, even if they have hidden objects. I'm focusing on features that differentiate the target from other visible objects, and making sure my description is robust in case there are hidden objects.

First, I analyzed the image. It's a 3x3 grid with four visible objects. The target is highlighted. Because I cannot use spatial locations like ""bottom middle,"" I need to make sure my description is specific enough to eliminate the target object from all the other ones.

I began by breaking down the target. It's a triangle with a thick black outline, and it's filled with grey, wavy, horizontal lines. The other visible objects are a green-outlined circle with vertical grey stripes, a red-outlined star with grey polka dots, and a black-outlined star with vertical grey stripes.

Now, how do I describe this? I started with the obvious: ""It's a triangle."" But that's risky if the listener sees a hidden triangle. The wavy line pattern is unique. I could say ""It's the shape with wavy lines inside."" This seemed good, but I decided to go a step further. I wanted to incorporate the shape, outline and pattern, because I have seen that there is another object with a thick, black outline.

I can't assume what the listener sees, so I need to be precise. The most robust approach seems to be combining the shape, outline, and pattern. I am going for conciseness but I am taking the safe approach by adding as much information as possible to eliminate any confusion.

I had several initial ideas: ""Select the triangle with a thick black outline and grey wavy lines inside."" or ""The object is a triangle with a black border, filled with grey wavy lines."" or ""It's the shape with wavy lines inside"" or ""It's the black-outlined triangle with a wavy pattern.""

Then I chose the best utterance from the list.

I did some additional checks. Is there another object with wavy lines? No. Is there another triangle? No. Is there another black outline? Yes, the star. So I *must* include both.

Therefore, the final description I've landed on is: ""The triangle with a thick black outline is filled with a grey wavy line pattern."" I'm confident that this description is unambiguous.
"
exp2_052.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,"triangle, triangular",black,checker,"2,1",The object is a triangle filled with a checkerboard pattern.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My task is to describe this target object so someone else can pick it out. Let's break this down systematically. First, I need to analyze the image. It's a 3x3 grid. Some cells have objects, some are empty, and some are hidden behind a red curtain with a question mark, which I'll assume the listener can see. The target is in the top row, middle column, highlighted with a red box.

Now, what is the target? It's a triangle. It has a thick black outline and a checkerboard pattern inside made of grey and white squares.

Next, the distractors. There's a circle in the bottom row, middle column with vertical grey and white stripes, and a square in the bottom right corner with its own grey and white checkerboard pattern. There are also two hidden objects behind those curtains, which I have to keep in mind, even though I can't see them.

My strategy is going to be to use the visual features, shape and pattern, to create an unambiguous description. Starting with the shape, 'triangle' is unique among the visible objects. However, the pattern 'checkerboard' is shared with the square, which would make the description ambiguous.

So, the key is to combine them. ""The triangle with a checkerboard pattern."" This combination eliminates the ambiguity. This should be sufficient but let's consider the hidden objects. Could there be another triangle with a different pattern? A solid color? Perhaps another checkerboard object of a different shape? ""The triangle with a checkerboard pattern"" is robust even against these possibilities. If there's another checkerboard pattern object that isn't a triangle, I'm safe. If there's another triangle that *isn't* checkerboard, I'm safe. The game design suggests the goal is to give the most accurate and unique description, based on what I can see.

Let's refine. ""It's a triangle"" is good, simple, but might not be enough. ""It has a checkerboard pattern"" is also good, but doesn't isolate the target object. ""It's the triangle with the checkerboard pattern"" is the most robust, it combines both key features. Checking for ambiguity again, I have a triangle, a circle and a square, the description ""the triangle with the checkerboard pattern"" is clear.

Alright, let's craft the final utterance. The prompt wants me to ""speak."" Let's keep it concise, precise, and a bit like a command.

**Final Answer:** ""The object is a triangle with a checkerboard pattern inside.""
"
exp2_053.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,"triangle, triangular",red,stripe,"1,1",The red triangle.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the highlighted target object so someone else can identify it from a set of distractors. My brain is going to rapidly analyze the visual information and formulate the most efficient and unambiguous description.

First, I'm zeroing in on the target. It's a triangle, outlined in red, with vertical grey stripes inside. I'm noting the obvious features first. Next, I'm mentally scanning the other objects: a blue-outlined square with grey dots, another blue square with vertical stripes, and a blue star with grey dots. There are also empty cells, and thankfully, no hidden objects or red curtains.

The key is finding unique descriptors. The obvious thing is that the target *is* a triangle and is *red*. Since there's only one triangle and only one red object, either of those descriptions (""the triangle"" or ""the red shape"") would technically be enough. However, I want to be *extra* clear, to ensure there's no misunderstanding. I want to be as unambiguous as possible, and I want the description to be *efficient* and concise.

I'm mentally rejecting descriptors like ""the object in the top left"" since the arrangement might vary. I also dismiss descriptors like ""the shape with vertical stripes"" because the other square also has those. I'm choosing ""the triangle"", or ""the shape with the red outline."" A good strategy would be to combine the unique features, like ""the red triangle."" This is very specific.

I'm double-checking. If I say ""The striped shape"", is it ambiguous? Yes, as there's a striped square. If I say ""The triangle,"" it's not ambiguous, and the same is true of ""The red shape."" I'm mentally putting myself in the listener's shoes, thinking, ""If I said 'The triangle', would they see a triangle and select it?"" Yes. ""If I said 'the red shape,' would they select a red shape and not another shape?"" Yes. The description should be simple and direct. I will not be verbose and use too many descriptors.

I'm considering potential for misinterpretation: could the listener mistake the star for a triangle? Unlikely. Is the listener colorblind? Possibly, but I'm going to assume standard perception unless I'm told otherwise.

Okay, let's keep it clean. I'll go with a description that uses both a shape and its outline color. ""The red triangle"". It is simple and direct and leaves no room for confusion.

I've got the features: triangle, red outline. I will provide a direct answer, ""The red triangle"".
"
exp2_054.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,"triangle, triangular",green,checker,"2,1",It's the triangle with the green outline and a checkerboard pattern inside.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My task is to describe this object so someone else can pick it out from the grid. Let's see... first, I need to *really* look at this image. It's a 3x3 grid, with five objects visible. The target is the green-outlined triangle with the grey and white checkerboard pattern.

Alright, step one: analyze. I see a few objects: a green-outlined square with stripes, the *target* green triangle, a black-outlined triangle with stripes, a black-outlined star with stripes, and a black-outlined square with dots. The target is clearly highlighted.

Now, let's break down the *target* object's features: it's a triangle, the outline is green, and inside it's got a grey and white checkerboard pattern.

The critical step: I need a description that's *unambiguous*. I need to differentiate it from all the others. ""The triangle"" isn't enough - there's another. ""The green object"" also doesn't cut it, there's a green square. ""The object with a checkerboard pattern"" is enough because it is the only item. ""The green triangle"" works. ""The triangle with a green outline"" works too. Combining the features, though... ""The green-outlined triangle with a checkerboard pattern."" Boom. Very precise.

Let's refine it for clarity and conciseness. ""The green triangle with the checkerboard pattern"" is good. ""The checkerboard triangle"" is a valid option, too. The prompt mentions a hidden element, but that's not relevant here.

Now, which description is the *best*? ""The green triangle"" is simple, it eliminates the black triangle. ""The triangle with the checkerboard pattern"" is excellent because that pattern is unique, and it distinguishes it from all the others. ""The green triangle"" is also good. I need something that mentions both shape and something that is unique.

I'm thinking about it now. Let's see. Triangle. Check. Green outline. Check. Checkerboard pattern. Unique to this object. Let's lead with the pattern as it's the strongest differentiator.

I'm going to say, ""It's the triangle with the checkerboard pattern."" That's perfect. Easy to understand. Or... let's combine a couple of features. How about, ""Please select the triangle that has a green outline and is filled with a checkerboard pattern."" Or I could say, ""The green triangle with the checkerboard pattern."" Or ""Select the green triangle."" It is unique. ""Select the triangle that has a green border."" They all work.

Okay, let's break it down again to double check the logic. 
- Green square with stripes
- **Green triangle with checkerboard** (Target)
- Black triangle with stripes
- Black star with stripes
- Black square with dots

My goal is something unambiguous: ""Select the green triangle with the checkerboard pattern."" ""Green"" rules out the black items, ""triangle"" gets rid of the green square, and ""checkerboard pattern"" solidifies it. All criteria met!

What's the best minimal approach? ""The green triangle"" is sufficient. ""The checkered triangle"" also is. I'm going with ""It's the triangle with the checkerboard pattern."" Feels natural, and focuses on the most unique attribute.

exp2_055.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,"triangle, triangular",blue,dot,"3,3",The triangle with dots inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object within this grid so that someone else can correctly select it. It's a 3x3 grid with three objects present, and the target is the triangle in the bottom right cell. I need to formulate a description that's both accurate and unambiguous, and I can't rely on spatial information. My primary concern is providing the other person with enough information to avoid confusion, especially given the ""hidden objects"" rule, even though I see all the objects right now.

First, I analyzed the image thoroughly. I identified three objects: a square with a blue border and checkerboard pattern, a black-bordered circle with grey dots, and my target: a blue-bordered triangle with grey dots. I’ve realized that I need to pinpoint distinctive features. Simple is often best, but since there is a “hidden object” caveat, I need to be more thorough to avoid an ambiguous description.

Next, I need to distinguish it from its distractors. The key features that I noticed are the shape, border color, and internal pattern.

*   The *square* has a blue border like the target, but its shape is square, and its pattern is a checkerboard.
*   The *circle* has a dotted pattern, but the border is black.

I am looking for properties that are *unique* to the target. Comparing the target to each distractor, I found:

*   **Target vs Square:** Shape (triangle vs square) and Pattern (dots vs checkerboard) are discriminating
*   **Target vs Circle:** Shape (triangle vs circle) and Border Color (blue vs black) are discriminating

I initially started brainstorming some descriptions. ""The triangle,"" seems simplest and is the *most* efficient way to identify the shape of the target when there are not hidden objects. Adding detail to the shape, I came up with: ""The object with a blue border and dots inside."" This is a solid option, covering the unique features of the target.

I began to evaluate those possibilities, weighing the pros and cons of each. ""The triangle"" *could* be enough, but the ""hidden objects"" rule introduces some uncertainty. Would a hidden triangle be confusing? I'm erring on the side of caution. If there were other triangles, I could be more descriptive, adding the features that are unique (e.g., “the blue triangle” or “the dotted triangle”).

Finally, I honed in on the fact that the target is unique in *sharing* features with both of the distractors. The other dotted object is a circle, and the other blue-bordered object is a square.

The key features are shape (triangle), border (blue), and pattern (dots).

Combining these, I’ve decided on ""The object that has both a blue border and dots inside"", or ""The triangle with dots inside"". This way, the person will *have* to check two properties to find it, guaranteeing they have the right one.
"
exp2_056.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,"triangle, triangular",blue,"wavy, zigzag","3,2",It's the triangle with the wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game and need to describe a target object within a grid, so the other player can identify it. First, I need to analyze the scene. It's a 3x3 grid, though some spots are empty. There are four objects and an important fact to note: the grid layout is potentially different for the listener. This means I can't rely on spatial terms like ""top-right"" or ""bottom-left."" I need to focus on object properties. The target is highlighted with a dashed red box, making it easy to spot.

I immediately identify the target. It's a blue triangle with a grey, wavy line pattern inside. My main task is to create a description that uniquely identifies it. I also recognize that this set of objects is a distractor set. I also recognize I should ignore the red curtain instruction.

I start by considering some initial descriptions. First ""The blue triangle."" Simple, using both color and shape. But is there another blue object? Nope. Another triangle? Yes, a red one. So, it's a valid choice. Then ""The triangle with the wavy pattern."" Is there another triangle? Yes, but it has a dotted pattern. Is there another object with a wavy pattern? Yes, a red circle. This also works. Finally, ""The blue object with the wavy pattern."" Since it’s the only blue object in the image, the adjective ""blue"" works as a sole identifier.

Next, I need to compare these potential descriptions. ""The blue object"" is concise, but the safest way to differentiate the target is to use color and shape. ""The blue triangle"" is similarly clear. So is ""the triangle with the wavy pattern"". Then ""The blue triangle with the wavy pattern"" seems over-specified, but it's crystal clear.

Now I need to select the *best* description. I consider how the listener might interpret my description, considering the objects shown. I need to make sure I am not creating confusion. I also assume the set of objects is the same. To compare the objects, I make a table of attributes: Shape, Color, Pattern.

*   **Target:** Triangle, Blue, Wavy
*   Distractor 1: Triangle, Red, Dotted
*   Distractor 2: Circle, Green, Dotted
*   Distractor 3: Circle, Red, Wavy

To make my description *unique*, it needs to be different from these items. The most unique aspect of the target object is its color—blue. No other object is blue. I realize ""the blue object"" would work but is it the most robust? If the listener can't see all the objects, ""the blue object"" might not be sufficient.

I'm thinking about making the description more robust. Then I test some combinations. I note that a wavy pattern uniquely differentiates the target from the dotted objects, and triangle makes the target unique from the circle. ""The blue triangle"" is an especially good option as it uses shape, color, and pattern. The color differentiates this from the red triangle.

I can make a strategy to include two features in a description. I try ""the triangle with the wavy pattern"" as my final choice, and I find that this works well. This seems like a great robust option. It uses the shape of a triangle combined with the ""wavy"" pattern and avoids ambiguity. That’s my chosen strategy.
"
exp2_057.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,"triangle, triangular",blue,"wavy, zigzag","3,1",Select the triangle with the wavy pattern inside.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to guide the other person to select the correct object from the 3x3 grid. The red dashed box has highlighted the target, but I can't just say, ""That one!"" I need to describe it in a way that's unambiguous.

First, I analyze the visual scene. I see a grid with some empty cells and some containing objects. Critically, there are also hidden objects behind the red curtains. This is important: I need to avoid accidentally describing something hidden. I focus on the visible components. There are two visible triangles with blue borders. The key difference I've identified is that one has a grey dotted pattern within, and the target object, highlighted by a red dashed box, features a wavy grey pattern inside.

Now, let's break down the target's features. Shape: Triangle. Border: Blue. Internal Pattern: Grey, wavy lines. I need to contrast this effectively against any visible distractors. The other visible triangle shares the same shape and border color, but the fill pattern is distinct: grey dots. I also need to think about the hidden objects. They are unknown, so I need to be as specific as possible about the visible features, as they may be identical to the target.

I'm aiming for clarity and conciseness, so I'll start formulating descriptions. Since both visible triangles have blue borders, mentioning that isn't *strictly* necessary for disambiguation, but it could provide extra helpful information. The critical differentiating feature is the internal pattern. Initially, I think, ""The triangle with the wavy pattern."" This seems accurate and concise, but I consider the possibility of ambiguity with hidden objects. I'm operating under the assumption that the other person knows what is behind the curtain and is able to see what I cannot, and that there are no additional identical triangles. Therefore, the best strategy is to describe its most unique visible feature, and that is the wavy pattern. So, the key is to describe the *visible* features.

I test out a few phrasing options, weighing their pros and cons. I could say, ""It's a triangle with a blue border and a grey wavy pattern inside."" It's incredibly precise, but might be a bit wordy. ""Select the triangle that has wavy lines inside."" Could also work. Ultimately, I decide to be concise, to stick with the clearest, most straightforward version. My final selection: ""The triangle with the wavy pattern."" That's the one I'm using.
"
exp2_058.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,"circle, circular",green,dot,"3,3",Select the green circle filled with grey dots.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, here's the task. I need to describe an object on a grid so that the other person, the listener, can pick it out. I'm acting as the speaker here. Crucially, I see a few things that the listener doesn't, like the dashed red box around the target. They also know what's behind a red curtain that I can only see. My goal is to be perfectly clear and unambiguous.

First, I analyzed the target. It's in a box I see, but I can't use that location. The object itself is a circle with a green outline. Inside, there's a pattern of many small grey dots arranged in a grid-like configuration against a white or very light grey background.

Now, let's consider the distractors. There's a red curtain with question marks (I can't see what's behind, but the listener *can* – this is key). There's also a red-outlined, grey wavy/zigzag patterned star, and then four empty white squares.

I ran through a mental checklist. I am the speaker, I need to describe the target, the other person's arrangement might differ, I can't use absolute location, and there's a hidden object. I gave myself a full score for this assessment, so I think I'm approaching this logically.

I thought through a few strategies. I could focus *only* on the target object's features, I could mention the distractors to add contrast, or I could try to account for the hidden object. The most straightforward strategy would be to just describe the target. The best strategy seems to be the simplest: ""Select the green circle filled with grey dots."" This is clear and distinguishes it from the star and the curtain.

I considered what might be *behind* the curtain. What if it's another circle? Or another *green* circle? My description should still work. I think the “grey dots” part is the key differentiator. It's the most unique feature. It's extremely unlikely that there's a green circle with *exactly* that pattern behind the curtain. Even if there were a green circle, my description would be unambiguous.

Refining my description, I started with ""green circle"" and added ""filled with grey dots."" The combination is robust. No ambiguity.

My final plan is to identify the shape, outline color, and internal pattern of the target, and then formulate a concise description that avoids location and is specific enough to avoid ambiguity with the other visible objects.

Therefore, my final description will be: ""It's a green circle that's filled with grey dots."" That should do the trick, no need to over-complicate things. It's clear, concise, and doesn't rely on location. I'm confident.
"
exp2_059.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,star,black,"wavy, zigzag","2,1",It's the star with the wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My goal is to describe a target object in an image so someone else can identify it. They can't see the image, but they know what's behind some red curtains. I can see the grid, and I can see that the target is in the top middle position of the grid. It's a 3x3 grid, and there are other objects visible, and some objects are hidden. I can't use spatial terms to describe the object's position, because that might be misleading to the listener.

First, I need to understand the visual information. The target is inside a red dashed box, but the listener can't see the box. I can see that the target is a five-pointed star. It has a thick black outline, and the inside is filled with a grey and white wavy line pattern with horizontal waves.

I need to quickly identify any other visible objects. I see a triangle in the top left corner with a black outline and the same wavy pattern. Then there's a square with a blue outline and grey and white vertical stripes in the bottom left corner. Finally, there are two unknown objects behind the curtains. I don't know what they are, and that's the tricky part of this game.

Now I need to form a description of the target. The key is to be unambiguous, even with the hidden objects in play. The star's shape is unique among the visible objects. It's clearly different from the triangle and the square. So, leading with ""it's the star"" seems like a good starting point. However, to be extra careful about what might be hidden, I need to add more detail.

Both the star and the triangle have the wavy pattern, so that's not a differentiating factor between them. However, they are different shapes, which could be useful. The square's outline is blue, unlike the star or triangle, which have black outlines. The square also has stripes, whereas the star and the triangle have wavy lines.

I start refining my description. ""It's the star"" is simple, but is it enough? What if there's another star behind the curtain? Probably not. Adding a detail is safer. So, “it’s the star filled with a wavy pattern” seems like it would work. However, there's another object with the wavy pattern - the triangle.

I could say, ""It's the star with the black outline and the wavy pattern inside."" That's comprehensive, but is it too verbose? Let's go through the details:

*   Shape: Star (unique among the visible objects)
*   Outline: Black (shared with the triangle)
*   Pattern: Wavy (shared with the triangle)

I need to focus on what makes the target unique. The shape is the most critical feature. The triangle is also wavy with a black outline. The square is a different shape and has stripes. Therefore, the shape is most critical.

So, I'll go with ""It's the star."" It could be enough.

To make the description even more robust, I'll refine it a little bit more. I'll include one more of the most salient features. Now, let's try some different ways to express this clearly.

*   ""The star with the wavy pattern."" Simple and effective.
*   ""It's a star filled with wavy horizontal lines.""
*   ""Select the star."" (Simplest of them all)
*   ""The shape is a star, and it's filled with a wavy gray and white pattern.""

I prefer simplicity, and the combination of shape and pattern is a good strategy.

So, I will say: ""It's the star with the wavy pattern."" This should be clear and not too verbose. It’s concise and should convey the distinguishing feature to the listener.

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to describe that object within the red dashed box so the listener can pinpoint it without any ambiguity. Let's break down my thought process, focusing on efficiency and clarity.

First, I need to *analyze the image* thoroughly. It's a 3x3 grid, but only three objects are present. This simplifies things. I see three shapes, all with a red border and some sort of internal grey pattern. The target, the star, and the square.

Now, my focus narrows to the *target object*. It's a circle with a wavy pattern inside. That's the key.

Next, I need to *formulate a description*. Spatial references are out; I need an intrinsic description that can transcend any positional variation. I need to focus on unique visual properties.

The core of my strategy is *comparison*. I'll compare the target to the other objects: the star with vertical stripes, and the square with dots. This directly highlights what makes the target distinct.

When it comes to the *drafting* stage, the object's shape (circle) is the strongest distinguishing factor. Then I consider the pattern. I think ""The object is a circle,"" then ""The object has wavy lines inside.""

Now I have two strong descriptive elements, and I'll consider how to *combine* them for maximum clarity. ""The object is a circle with a wavy pattern inside"" seems robust. ""It's the circular object"" might work in this case. It seems the best.

Finally, the *finalizing* stage. ""The object is a circle that has a wavy pattern inside,"" that's clean and direct. I could add more information, like the color, but that's redundant. I will stick with the core features, the distinctive properties of the object itself.

My final thought is, ""I choose the most concise and precise description. The combination of shape (circle) and pattern (wavy) is unique."" The instruction is ""The object is a circle that has a wavy pattern inside.""

exp2_061.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,star,green,stripe,"2,1",It's the green star with vertical stripes inside.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, here's how I'm thinking through this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: identify the ""green star with vertical stripes inside"" (the target) so that the listener can pick it out, too. The listener sees what I see, and understands that I know the contents of the hidden cells (behind the red curtains).

First, I need to break down the image. I'm looking at a 3x3 grid, a green star with vertical grey stripes inside the star, a red-bordered triangle with wavy grey stripes, and two mystery cells hidden behind red curtains. I know the listener can see these hidden cells, and I cannot.

Next, I need to hone in on the salient features. The most defining characteristics are the shape and pattern. The target is a star with a green border and filled with vertical stripes. The distractors – the triangle and the hidden objects – will hopefully be uniquely different. Shape-wise, the target is a star, while the distractor is a triangle. Colour-wise, the target is green, while the distractor is red. Pattern-wise, the target has vertical stripes, while the distractor is wavy.

My primary goal is to create a description that is unambiguous and will uniquely identify the target. I've considered that the listener might have a different setup, so using any location cues is off-limits. I must also consider the hidden objects – the description must still work even if there are more stars, triangles, etc., behind the curtains.

Now, I'm formulating my description. I could just say ""the star,"" but that might not be sufficient. ""The green star"" is better. ""The star with vertical stripes"" is also good, since the pattern is a key differentiator. The ideal description will be the most comprehensive and unique possible. ""The green star with vertical stripes inside"" seems bulletproof. It leverages shape (star), color (green), and pattern (vertical).

I am keeping things efficient. ""The green star"" is probably the most concise and effective description if the hidden objects are not green stars. ""The star with vertical stripes inside"" is also great, but it requires the listener to distinguish this from any potential star behind the curtain. Since there are multiple distinguishing factors in this image, I'll combine the information for maximum clarity:

My final description: ""It's the green star with vertical stripes inside.""
"
exp2_062.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,square,green,dot,"2,3",Select the square with polka dots.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I need to describe this object so someone else can pick it out. First, I have to *really* look at it. Square shape, green outline, grey polka dots on a white background, solid line outline. Don't mention the red box around it, though, that's not part of the description.

Next, I scan the distractors. Circle with black outline, polka dots. Triangle, red outline, stripes. Circle, blue outline, wavy lines. Triangle, green outline, polka dots. Hmm, and I have to be ready for the fact that other objects could be *hidden* from view.

Now, let's craft a description. ""It's a square."" Well, is there another square? Nope. That could work! However, it's safer to provide another clue:  ""It has a green outline."" The triangle has a green outline, too, darn. Polka dots? Both the circle and triangle have those. Combining? ""The green square."" Nice, but what if there's a hidden, green square? ""The square with polka dots."" Is that the best?

Now, which is the *best* description? It has to be *efficient* and *unambiguous*. Shape is unique here: ""Select the square"" is super efficient.  But I should add a feature or two in case something's hidden. ""The square with a green outline"" sounds rock solid. The ""square filled with polka dots"" works equally as well.

Let's refine the language. ""The object is a square."" Simple, direct. ""It's the only square."" Emphasizes the uniqueness. ""It's a green square with polka dots."" Good, detailed, but maybe too detailed?

My focus is the shape, as that is the *only* distinctive feature. It's safe to say ""It's the square.""

So, let's double-check. Shape: Square (unique) versus Circle (2) and Triangle (2). Color: Green (2) versus Black (1), Blue (1), Red (1). Pattern: Polka dots (3) versus Vertical stripes (1), Wavy lines (1). The best feature is the shape (square).

Now, what's simplest? ""It's the square."" Could add more like ""The square with a green outline"" or ""The square with polka dots."" But, let's keep it minimal: ""It's the square"".

There's the green triangle. It shares the same color, *and* pattern! I can distinguish the object by its shape.

Target: Square, Green, Polka dots
Distractor 1: Triangle, Green, Polka dots
Distractor 2: Circle, Black, Polka dots

To distinguish from Distractor 1, I need to mention it's a square. I can also mention it is a square or that it's green or polka dots to distinguish from Distractor 2.

So, ""It's the square"" works. ""It's the green square"" works too. And ""The square with polka dots"" also works.

The best choice? ""It's the square"" is the most concise. Maybe ""The square with polka dots.""

The fact that it is the *only* square is what matters.

My goal is a minimal, sufficient description. Something that combines a shape and one other feature would be best, just to be on the safe side.

""It's the square with the green outline.""
""It's the square filled with polka dots.""

Both are very good. However, ""The square with polka dots"" is the best. It's a perfect balance: unique shape and pattern. Clear and efficient. ""It's the square"" or ""Select the square."" seems most confident.

Let's go with, ""The square with polka dots"". It's the simplest and most effective.

exp2_063.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,2,"triangle, triangular",red,stripe,"3,2",The striped triangle.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the goal is clear: to describe an object within a visual grid so that someone can identify it. I need to be precise and unambiguous. First, I'm analyzing the image. It's a 3x3 grid, and there are three objects visible. The target, indicated by the red box, is in the middle-right cell. It's a triangle with a red outline and vertical grey stripes inside. The other objects are a dotted triangle with a black outline and a striped square with a green outline.

Now, I'm identifying the target and its key features: it’s a red, striped triangle. I need to distinguish it from the distractors, so I'm thinking about what makes it unique. Comparing it to the dotted triangle, the differences are the outline color (red vs. black) and the fill (stripes vs. dots). Comparing it to the striped square, the differences are the shape (triangle vs. square) and the outline color (red vs. green). The vertical grey stripes are a shared feature with the square, so I should be careful how I use this to make a distinction.

I'm starting to formulate a description. A good starting point would be to mention both shape and fill pattern because they are both distinct. Thinking through the possibilities, I could say ""the triangle with vertical stripes,"" or ""the red triangle"". However, I feel ""the triangle with vertical stripes"" is best and most efficient. It clearly identifies it as a triangle, and the stripes distinguish it from the dotted triangle. And although the other object also has stripes, it is a square. So, the description covers both of the potential distractors.

Let's test it: Is there another triangle with stripes? No. Is there another object that could be described as ""the triangle with stripes""? No. The only other striped shape is a square, and the only other triangle is dotted. I think ""The striped triangle"" is the best option because it is concise and unambiguous. Combining both shape and fill is the best approach for this situation.

Finally, I'm giving it a final check. My utterance is ""The striped triangle."" It refers to the correct object, it's unambiguous, it's spatially neutral, and it's simple and clear. Perfect. I'll use that.

exp2_064.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,star,red,dot,"1,2",Select the star with the red outline.,"**My Analysis of the Reference Game**

Okay, here's how I'm approaching this. The goal is to clearly describe the target object so someone else can pick it out, and the image is my only source of information. I'm imagining the user is an expert, so I will ensure the language is unambiguous, with no superfluous verbiage.

First, I need to understand the visual field. I'm looking at a 3x3 grid with four visible objects. My target, highlighted for me, is a red-outlined star with a dotted pattern, and it's in the middle-left cell. To avoid misleading the user with spatial references, I'll ignore any mention of the grid positions and concentrate on the intrinsic characteristics of the objects.

Now, I'm identifying the potential distractors. There's a green-outlined triangle with a wavy pattern, a blue-outlined triangle with a wavy pattern, and a blue-outlined square with a dotted pattern. My immediate priority is to find the unique distinguishing features of the target object – the things that *only* the target possesses.

The target object is a star, outlined in red, and has a grey dotted pattern on the inside. Looking at the distractors, I see that the green and blue shapes are triangles and the blue shape is a square. They all have unique features, the wavy pattern is also present on two objects. The color red is only present on the target object.

I need to create descriptions that will be specific.

I could simply say, ""Select the star."" It's direct, but is it the *best*? What if there were other stars hidden from view? What if there's a different star with a different pattern? To be thorough, I should look at combining features, the pattern, outline color, and shape.

""The red star"" is the simplest. However, the pattern alone is shared. So the combination of the two, the shape and the color, seems best. I also need to be aware of any potential hidden objects, it's possible the listener has objects that I don't see.

Combining those features is the safest strategy. Given the knowledge that this game could be ambiguous if there are hidden objects, I need to be as precise as possible, so the combination is the best strategy. The best description would be ""the red star"" or ""the red object with the dotted pattern"". However, combining the two most unique visible features seems safest. ""The red star"" is better because it's more concise.

exp2_065.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,square,blue,checker,"3,2",It's the square with a blue border and a grey and white checkerboard pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game, and my goal is to describe an object in this 3x3 grid so that another person can identify it. I need to make sure my description is clear and unambiguous.

First, I need to understand what I'm looking at. I can see a grid, some empty cells, some cells with objects, and two hidden objects behind red curtains. The visible objects are a star with a red outline and a grey wavy pattern, and the target object, which is a grey and white checkerboard pattern within a blue frame, highlighted with a dashed red box.

Now, I'll break down the target object's features. It's a square, it has a checkerboard pattern (grey and white), and it has a solid blue border. The other visible object, the star, has a red outline and a grey and white wavy pattern inside. I should formulate a description that sets the checkerboard apart from the star and those hidden objects. Locating the object within the grid is not allowed, so I must focus on its visual properties.

""The checkerboard"" is a good start. However, ""the grey and white checkerboard"" is more specific. The blue border makes it even more unique. I can't assume what's behind the curtains. I'm focusing on what I can see. Is the hidden object a square object? ""The square object with a checkerboard pattern and a blue frame"" might work.

I need to make this description as complete and unambiguous as possible. ""It's the square with a blue border that has a grey and white checkerboard pattern inside"" seems very descriptive, which covers all the key features.

Now, I'll refine this. What are the most salient and unique features of the target object? Definitely the checkerboard pattern and the blue border. The star has a red border and a wavy pattern.

So, ""the checkerboard"" *might* be enough, but to be safe, I should add more details. I could say, ""The square with the checkerboard pattern."" Also, ""the object with the blue border"". And, ""The grey and white checkerboard inside a blue frame.""

I think that ""The grey and white checkerboard inside a blue frame"" is the most complete description. It separates this object from the star (different shape, pattern, border color) and it should be specific enough to be difficult to confuse with a hidden object, unless they were very similar. Since I'm only giving one instruction, I need to make it as clear as I can.

I could say, ""Select the square that has a blue frame and a grey and white checkerboard pattern inside."" Or, ""A grey and white checkerboard pattern inside a square with a blue border.""

Considering the prompt wants me to be a ""speaker,"" I'll keep it simple and direct. ""The object with the blue border and the checkerboard pattern."" This focuses on the two key unique features. The other object has a red border and a wavy pattern, so it should be easy to separate. Done.

exp2_066.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,"circle, circular",black,dot,"1,1",It's the circle with the black outline.,"**Analyzing and Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being asked to play a reference game. My task is to describe an object so someone else can identify it, avoiding spatial cues since the arrangement might change. I'm looking at a dashed red box containing the target object. It's time to break down the object's features and figure out how to best communicate its identity.

First, I need to analyze the target object. It's a circle. The outline is black, and the fill is a pattern of grey dots – essentially polka dots. While it's in the top-left position right now, I have to disregard that spatial information.

Next, I'll examine the other objects, the distractors. There's a triangle with a black outline and vertical grey stripes. Another circle has a blue outline and wavy grey lines inside, almost like chevrons. A star has a blue outline and the same grey dot fill as some other objects. Finally, another triangle features a blue outline and, again, grey dots.

Now, I'm thinking about the strategy for describing the object effectively. I need a referring expression that differentiates the target from the distractors. Just saying ""the circle"" wouldn't work; there are two circles. ""The one with dots"" is also too ambiguous, as there are other objects with grey dots. And saying ""the one with the black outline"" wouldn't cut it, because the triangle also has a black outline. I need to combine features.

Let's test combinations: ""The circle with the black outline."" That seems promising. Is this unique? Yes, it is unique. It distinguishes the circle from the blue-outlined one, and it differentiates it from the triangle with the black outline. There isn't any other circle with a black outline in the grid. This seems like a concise way to do it.

Alternatively, ""The circle with the dots"" would work as well. The other circle does not have dots. So this would also be a good description.

I could also go for ""The one with the black outline and dots."" This description is definitely unique: there is no other object with both a black outline and dots. It distinguishes the target from the black-outlined object (which has stripes) and the other objects with dots (which are blue).

So, all three combined descriptions would be effective. ""The circle with the black outline,"" ""The circle with the dots,"" and ""The one with the black outline and dots"" all work perfectly to isolate the target object.

I need to decide which description is best. ""The circle with the black outline"" is the most direct and efficient, contrasting nicely with the other circle that has a blue outline. ""The circle with the dots"" is also a great contender, as it contrasts with the other circle with the wavy fill. ""The one with the black outline and dots"" is a bit longer but perfectly clear.

I am leaning towards ""The circle with the black outline"". I think that will be my final answer. It is very concise and unambiguous.

exp2_067.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,square,blue,"wavy, zigzag","2,1",The square with the grey and white wavy pattern that has a blue border.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My goal is to describe a specific object in an image so that someone else can identify it. First, I need to analyze the scene. It's a grid, but it's not a complete one – more like a 2x3 or 3x2 with some empty cells. There are a total of four visible objects and empty squares.

I see two identical red curtains with question marks. I can't describe what's *behind* them, so I should consider them as a single type, ""curtain with question mark."" Then, there are two squares with a grey and white wavy pattern. One of these wavy squares has a blue border, and that's my target (indicated by the red dashed box). The other wavy square has a red border. The rest of the grid is empty.

To make an effective description, I have to figure out how to distinguish the target from the other visible objects. The most similar distractor is the other wavy-patterned square. They share the same pattern. The critical difference is the border color – the target has a blue border, and the other has a red border. So the best approach is to highlight that unique feature. ""The square with the blue border"" should work, but it's always better to be as clear as possible.

Since the patterns are identical, I'll go with ""The square with the grey and white wavy pattern and a blue border"". This is concise and accurate, and it leaves no room for confusion. Alternatively, ""The wavy square with the blue border"" should also work. I can also consider it this way: “Select the item with the blue border”. I want to be concise, yet specific, so the listeners doesn't misunderstand.

I also have to consider the hidden information: The listener ""knows"" what's behind the curtains. I, the speaker, do not. So, my description must be based solely on *visible* features. If there was another object behind the curtains with a blue border, my current description would become ambiguous. But based on only the visible items, the blue border is the best distinguishing factor.

Therefore, ""The square with the grey and white wavy pattern and a blue border,"" or ""The wavy square with the blue border"" seems like the most effective description because it highlights both the common feature and the distinguishing feature. The ""blue border"" part is crucial, and the ""wavy pattern"" helps the listener identify the general object.
"
exp2_068.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,star,black,stripe,"2,1",It's the star with the black outline.,"**My Thought Process: Selecting the Target Object**

Okay, so I need to act as the speaker in a reference game. My objective is to describe the highlighted target object so that someone else can correctly identify it. I'm focusing on the visible elements, as the items hidden behind the red curtains are unknown. Let's break this down systematically.

First, I need to pinpoint the target object. I've identified it: it's a star, located in the top row, middle column. I notice it has a black outline, and inside, it features vertical grey and white stripes.

Next, I need to analyze the other objects (the distractors) to differentiate the target. There's a triangle with a green outline and white dots on a grey background, another star with a blue outline and vertical grey and white stripes, a red-outlined triangle with a grey and white checkerboard pattern. There are also two items hidden behind curtains.

Now, the core of the challenge: forming a description that uniquely identifies the target. My initial thought, ""It's a star,"" is insufficient because there's another star in the display. Same with ""It's the star with vertical stripes"" as the other star has that feature, too. So, the key is what makes this star *different* from all the others, especially the visible ones.

Then I realized that ""It's the star with the black outline"" is a good differentiator. The other star has a blue outline, and the triangles have green and red outlines. The outline color becomes the primary distinguishing factor. I considered combining features for robustness, thinking about ""The star with a black outline and vertical stripes inside,"" but it might be overkill. ""The star with the black outline"" is concise.

I thought about other ways to phrase it for clarity: ""The star that is outlined in black,"" ""The star with the black border."" But I need the shortest and clearest phrase.

To ensure uniqueness, I did a mental check. Is it enough? The outline color is the differentiator; ""black"" clearly distinguishes it from the blue-outlined star, while the word ""star"" will distinguish from the two triangles.

So, I'm confident that ""The star with the black outline"" is the best option. I'm avoiding any spatial descriptions like ""the one in the top row"" because the user's arrangement could be different. I will also make my description as specific as possible based solely on the objects that are currently visible, and not describe the red box, as it is only visible to me. I made certain to also ensure that my description is as unique as possible.

Therefore, the best description: ""The star with the black outline."" Shape (star) + Outline Color (black) = Perfect!

exp2_069.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,2,square,green,dot,"1,1","The object is a square with a green border, filled with grey dots.","**My Thought Process for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object clearly and unambiguously so someone else can select it from a potential set of options. First, I need to analyze the setup. I'm presented with a 3x2 grid. In the visible part of the grid, I see three objects: a square, a triangle, and a rectangle. The target is the square with the green border and filled with grey dots.

I can't rely on spatial descriptions (""top-left"") because the listener might have a different arrangement. There's also the crucial constraint: there *could* be hidden objects. This means I can't assume that the objects I see are the *only* objects. My description needs to be robust enough to uniquely identify the target even if there are other, unseen, objects. I'm thinking about how a human would approach this.

My strategy is to break down the target into its key features: shape, border color, and fill pattern. I'll compare these features against the other visible objects to identify what distinguishes the target. The square is the key starting point because of its shape; the target has a green border, which is another differentiating feature, and it has grey dots inside, which is the last differentiating feature.

Let's see: the target square is green, which differentiates it from the blue triangle and the blue rectangle. The fill pattern (grey dots) distinguishes it from the wavy lines in the rectangle. Comparing the target with the other objects, I can see that none of them share this precise combination.

So, I need to craft a description that captures these distinguishing features, while keeping in mind that there might be other objects hidden from view. I am aiming for conciseness but I can not compromise accuracy for speed.

Several options come to mind: ""The green square filled with dots,"" ""the square with the green border filled with dots,"" or even ""select the square with a green border that is filled with grey dots.""

My primary concern is that a hidden object might be a square or might have a green border. But the combination of *all three* features (green color, square shape, and dot pattern) is probably unique. If there are other squares, or other green objects, I know the listener can look for ones that exactly match *all* these features. If there are other squares they should be described as squares. If there are other greens, they should be described as greens.

The ""green square filled with dots"" is precise, doesn't use spatial terms, and is likely to be unique even with hidden objects because it uses three of the target object's most distinct features. It also sounds pretty natural.

I am now confident that this description is a solid approach that is clear, concise, and robust to handle the hidden-object constraint.

exp2_070.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,square,green,checker,"1,3",Select the square object.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My task is to describe this target object so someone else can pick it out from a set of distractors. The target is highlighted, so I've already identified that. Now, let's break this down systematically.

First, I need to *clearly* identify the target object. It's a square, it's in the bottom left cell, it has a green border, and the interior is a grey and white checkerboard pattern.

Next, I need to analyze all the other objects, the ""distractors."" I see a few circles with black and red borders, one has a star, all with various internal patterns (checkerboard, wavy lines, stripes). There are also empty cells.

Now for the crucial part: formulating the description. I need to be *unambiguous*. So, I'm thinking, what's unique? The square shape is a strong candidate, as there are no other squares. The green border is also unique. However, the checkerboard pattern is shared with other objects (the circles), so using that alone isn't going to cut it.

I'm thinking ""The square with the green border"" is likely the most robust description. It directly combines two of the most salient, unique features. However, let's explore simplicity. What about just ""The square""? It's concise. Is it sufficient? The prompt mentions potentially hidden objects behind a red curtain, so I need to be cautious. Even so, the basic assumption of these games is to use whatever is unique *in the view*. So, in my context, it's the only square.

I'm reviewing the description options:

*   ""Select the square object."" This is simple, and clear, since there's only one.
*   ""The object with the green border"" - this works since only one object has the green border.
*   ""It's the square with the green border."" - This is an even better and concise combination.

I'm considering potential ambiguities. What if there is a hidden green circle or red square? I'm not shown any curtains in this image, so I'm assuming for now that everything I see is what the other person sees. If the target is the only green-bordered object on the listener's side, then ""the object with the green border"" is fine. The same is true for the square object. The safest and robust description would be ""The square with the green border."" However, usually, a single unique feature is enough.

After considering each feature in isolation, I am sticking with shape as the primary characteristic since it is a defining attribute.

I'm going to go with **""Select the square object.""** It's concise, clear, and unambiguous based on what I see.

exp2_071.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,square,black,checker,"1,2",It's the checkerboard with the black border.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to guide the listener to select the right object from a set of visual options. I'm given the image, and I need to formulate a description that's both accurate and efficient.

First, I need to break down the image. It's a 3x3 grid, and there are some specific elements within it. Right now, I can see four distinct objects: two identical red curtains with question marks (which I can't directly refer to, but will impact my overall strategy since the other player knows these as well), and two checkerboards. It's crucial that I identify and distinguish the target object.

The object I'm tasked to describe is the checkerboard in the middle-left cell. But there is a distractor, another checkerboard in the bottom-center. I need to differentiate this target checkerboard pattern from the distractor checkerboard. The key is in the visual features. Both have the same checkerboard pattern, the distinctive difference lies in their borders. The target has a thin black border inside the dashed red border, while the other has a thick green border.

My goal is to create a concise, unambiguous description. Spatial references are out; ""left"" or ""middle"" are relative and potentially misleading. I need a description that would still work even if the arrangement of the grid were shifted.

I could say ""the checkerboard with the black border"". It's simple, direct, and focuses on the differentiating feature. There are no other checkers in the visible grid. I could also say ""the checkerboard without the green border"", but that's a less direct. I'll stick to a positive description, minimizing ambiguity.

The most important consideration is potential ambiguity. I can't know what's behind the hidden curtains. Therefore, I need to base my description on visible features only, assuming that the other checkerboard is indeed visible to the listener.

So, after a final check, my definitive description is: ""The checkerboard with the black border."" It's specific, utilizes a salient feature, and avoids any potentially confusing spatial references. It accounts for the distractor, and allows me to describe the target as accurately and concisely as possible.

exp2_072.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,star,black,stripe,"3,2",Select the five-pointed star with a black outline and vertical grey and white stripes inside.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game. My objective is to describe an object, in this case a star, within a 3x3 grid, in such a way that the other person can identify it, even though they can't see the grid exactly as I see it. It's crucial I don't give away its location; their view might be different. I have to rely on visual properties alone.

My immediate analysis focuses on what I can see. I've got a star, which is highlighted as the target, a circle, and two cells with question-mark curtains obscuring what's behind them. I can't be sure what's behind the curtains, so I need to make my description robust enough to handle any potential object.

First, I observe the visual characteristics. The target is a five-pointed star with a thick, black outline, and it has these vertical stripes inside, alternating grey and white. I need to make sure this distinguishes it from the circle – which I see has a red outline and grey dots in a grid pattern.

My initial thoughts are to start simple: ""It's a star."" But that's too vague, especially if there's another star hidden. The next step is to increase specificity: ""It's a five-pointed star with a black outline."" Better, but perhaps not enough. So I consider adding the stripes.

I then go through a few iterations of phrasing. I think about ""It's a star with vertical grey and white stripes inside."" and refine it to ""The object is a five-pointed star with a thick black border. The inside of the star is filled with vertical stripes that are grey and white."" That's comprehensive. But is it too much? I'm balancing clarity with brevity. I also contemplate ""It's the star with vertical stripes."" – short, sweet, effective if the other objects are simple.

Since I don't know what's behind those curtains, I decide on the safest, most precise route: ""Select the five-pointed star with a black outline and vertical grey and white stripes."" I'm confident that these three attributes – the shape, the outline, and the internal pattern – offer a unique and clear identifier for this particular star. It covers all the bases. I'm satisfied.

Okay, so I'm in a reference game. My objective is crystal clear: I need to describe a specific object in a 3x3 grid so that my partner, the listener, can identify it. Here's how I'm breaking down this challenge.

First, I see the playing field. It's a grid, and some cells are empty, while others contain objects. Crucially, some cells are obscured by red curtains with question marks. I can't see what's behind those, but my partner can. My target object is marked with a dashed red box – something only *I* can see.

Let's inventory the visible objects. There's a star with a black outline and a checkerboard pattern. Another object is a red curtain. And, finally, my target! It's a star with a green outline and vertical grey and white stripes inside. Two cells contain red curtains.

My initial thoughts? ""It's a star."" Pretty obvious, right? But then I realize: there are *two* stars. The simple description won't cut it. I need to differentiate. So, the distinguishing features are the *outline* and the *pattern*. The other star has a black outline and a checkerboard pattern. My target has a green outline and vertical stripes.

Now, here's where it gets interesting. I have to consider the hidden objects. Since the listener sees these as well, my description needs to be specific enough to eliminate any possible confusion or ambiguity. There might be another star behind one of those curtains. What if it's green? Or striped? I need to be careful and as specific as possible.

So, I start drafting descriptions: ""It's a star."" Too vague. ""It's the green star."" Better, but still risky. ""It's the star with the green outline."" More precise. ""It's the star with stripes inside."" Also precise. ""It's the star with the green outline and vertical stripes inside."" Bingo! That's the most specific I can be with what I see.

Given my expert understanding of visual disambiguation, I'm leaning toward maximum specificity. If there *is* another green object behind a curtain, ""the green star"" is ambiguous. It must be a combination of descriptive traits. I combine the shape, color, and internal pattern.

Therefore, the final description must be: ""The star with the green outline and vertical stripes."" That covers the key distinguishing features from the other visible star. And, I'm betting that this is specific enough to identify it from any potential hidden objects. I'm ready to roll!

Okay, so I need to describe a specific object from this grid so someone else can identify it. First, let's break down what's there. It's a 3x3 grid with four objects displayed: a dotted star, a striped triangle, a checkered square, and a wavy-patterned square. My target is the wavy-patterned square. It's marked, but I'll describe it as if the other person doesn't know.

Now, I'll identify the key features. It's a square, with a thick black outline, and it has a gray wavy pattern inside. The other objects are: the star with dots, the triangle with vertical stripes, and the checkerboard square with a red outline.

Let's formulate a good description. I can't rely on spatial location, so I need to focus on shape, pattern, and outline. The pattern is the most unique feature. The target has wavy lines inside, whereas the other shapes have dots, stripes, or checkers. The outline is also different; the other square has a red outline. I should use this to my advantage.

I'm thinking, ""the square with the wavy pattern."" This is a strong descriptor that avoids ambiguity. It immediately distinguishes it from the star, triangle, and other square. I could also say ""the square with the black outline,"" as that differentiates it from the red-outlined square. However, since the star and triangle also have black outlines, ""the square"" is still necessary to avoid confusion. Combining them is possible: ""the square with the wavy pattern and a black outline,"" but that's a bit verbose.

The pattern is the most salient feature, so let's focus on that: ""the square with the wavy pattern."" That should be sufficient. I'm going to double-check that this is accurate. Yep. The other shapes have different patterns. The shapes are also different. The outlines are also different.

I'll lean towards the pattern. It's concise and robust. I could add ""The square with the black outline,"" but the wavy pattern is the defining characteristic.

Therefore, the final utterance will be: ""The square with the wavy pattern."" It's clear, precise, and unambiguous. And sounds natural. I think that's the best approach here to make my intention clear.

exp2_075.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,star,red,"wavy, zigzag","3,2",The object is a star with a wavy pattern inside.,"**My Reasoning Process for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My goal is to describe a target object within this grid so that someone else can identify it. I need to be precise, but also efficient with my words.

First, I need to understand the scene. There's a 3x3 grid, but only three objects are visible. One is a red-outlined triangle with a checkerboard pattern, another is a black-outlined square with vertical stripes, and the target – highlighted by that red box – is a star with a red outline and a wavy gray and white pattern inside. The other cells are empty.

Now, my task is to pinpoint the star. I can't use spatial terms like ""top-left"" because the other person's view might be different. So, I need to focus on *intrinsic* properties: shape, outline color, and the fill pattern and color.

The star's shape is unique *among the visible objects*. The other ones are a triangle and a square. That's a strong starting point: ""The star"". No other object shares that. But, what if the listener can't see all the objects, or if there's a hidden object? I should also look at other attributes.

The red outline is a common attribute shared with the triangle. The gray and white fill is also shared between all objects. However, the *wavy* pattern inside the star is distinct. The triangle has a checkerboard, the square has stripes.

So, I need to use the unique properties: Shape (star) and pattern (wavy). ""The star"" is a simple description, but I can add more detail to improve robustness.

I could say, ""The star,"" ""The star with the wavy fill pattern,"" or ""The shape filled with wavy lines."" Considering the possibility of a hidden object, the more descriptors I use the better.

I'm thinking ""The star has a wavy gray pattern inside"" might be the best. It's concise, mentions both the shape and the wavy pattern. It also mentions the color, which is a common attribute but adds detail. However, ""The star with the wavy gray and white pattern inside"" is better. So the most robust description is ""It's the star with the wavy gray and white pattern inside."" This avoids using the common attributes and focuses on the unique ones. Now I am done.

exp2_076.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,"triangle, triangular",green,stripe,"1,3",The object is a triangle with a green outline and vertical stripes inside.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to guide the listener to select the target object, which I can see is a green-outlined triangle with vertical grey stripes inside. I'm instructed to focus on the object's features and not its location – that's a key constraint I need to internalize.

I'm mentally running through the other visible objects: a green-outlined square with grey dots, and a red-outlined star with a grey and white checkerboard pattern.  My primary challenge is to create a description that uniquely identifies the triangle.

My thought process hinges on distinguishing features. Let's break it down:

*   **Shape:** The triangle itself is a primary discriminator. It's the only triangle present.
*   **Outline Color:** The green outline is shared with the square, so on its own, it's not enough for unique identification.
*   **Internal Pattern:** The vertical grey stripes are unique. The square has dots, and the star has a checkerboard pattern.

I consider potential ambiguities. Phrases like ""the green object"" are out because of the shared green outline.  ""The object with a grey pattern"" is also a no-go since all three objects have a grey pattern. And I definitely need to avoid spatial descriptions.

My optimal strategy: Combine a shape and a unique internal feature. Using the shape seems like the most direct route. I am going to make a clear and descriptive sentence. I'm leaning toward something that mentions both the shape and the internal pattern.

Let's test some phrasing.

*   ""The object is a triangle with a green outline and vertical stripes inside."" This description is complete.
*   ""It's the triangle with the vertical stripes."" This is more concise.
*   ""It's the green triangle with vertical stripes."" This is also concise.

I'll re-analyze the other objects to be absolutely sure: the goal is the green-outlined triangle with vertical grey stripes and the distractors are the green-outlined square with grey dots, and the red-outlined star with a grey and white checkerboard pattern.

Given the potential for hidden objects (mentioned in the prompt), I'll err on the side of being more specific. This is not a situation where brevity trumps clarity.

Therefore, my final description:  ""The object is a triangle with a green outline and vertical stripes."" This is comprehensive enough, I believe. I'm focusing on the shape (triangle) and the internal feature (vertical stripes), and the outline color to ensure accurate identification. The goal is to be as clear as possible.

exp2_077.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,"circle, circular",blue,stripe,"1,3","It's the circle with a blue outline, filled with vertical gray stripes.","**My Thought Process: Describing a Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with acting as a speaker in a reference game. My primary objective is clear: describe the highlighted object in a way that allows another person to select it accurately. I need to be precise and robust, even with potentially hidden elements.

First, I need to *analyze* the image. I see a 3x3 grid with both filled and empty cells. Crucially, some cells are obscured by red curtains, which means I have incomplete information. My target is the object within the red dashed box in the bottom-left.

Next, I *identify* the visible target object. It's a circle, outlined in blue, with a pattern of vertical gray stripes inside. I then look at the *other visible objects* (the distractors): there is a blue-outlined triangle with dots, a black-outlined triangle with wavy lines. The other two grid cells are obscured.

Now, I begin to *formulate descriptions*. I start with the shape, a “circle”, which is useful because there are no other visible circles. The “blue outline” is another great feature to distinguish it from the black-outlined triangle. Finally, the internal pattern of “vertical gray stripes” is very distinct. These three features, shape, outline, and pattern are my starting points for the descriptions.

I *consider the hidden objects*, as the other person can see behind the curtains. A good description must be robust enough to work even if there are competing similar features that I don't see.

I then *draft multiple descriptions*, considering their pros and cons. A simple “It’s a circle” might be too vague. “It's the blue-outlined circle with vertical stripes inside,” is very precise and combines all three features, making it a good candidate. I want a combination of the features. I realize that the *most* distinctive visible feature combination is “shape + pattern”. Therefore, I draft more precise descriptions such as, ""The circle with vertical stripes.""

Ultimately, the best description needs to be as unambiguous as possible. It has to cover all the features to make it easy to select even if the other person has other objects. So, I choose ""It's the circle with the blue outline and vertical gray stripes"" as the clearest and most robust description. This phrase is easy to communicate. I'm going to ensure the recipient can easily and correctly pick out the target object.

exp2_078.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,"triangle, triangular",red,stripe,"2,1",It's the triangle with the red outline.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game and need to describe the target object so the other player can select it. Let's break this down systematically. First, I need to *analyze the image.* It's a grid, but some cells are merged. I see a top row with two triangles (one with a green outline, one with a red outline – *that* one is the target), an empty cell. The middle row has an empty cell, and then a square filled with dots. The bottom row has a mysterious red curtain covering potentially one or two objects, and then a star.

Right, the target is the red-outlined triangle. Now, let's think about *distractors*. The green triangle is the closest, identical except for the outline. Then there's the square, completely different shape, different fill. The star, also a different shape, but similar fill (stripes), just different colors. And then, the unknown objects hidden behind the curtain. I have to make a description that's robust against anything that might be there.

My *initial thought* is ""It's the red triangle."" Simple enough. But what if there's another red object behind the curtain? Or another triangle? Okay, so I should be more precise. ""It's the triangle with the red outline"" is better. That definitely nails down the key differentiator.

Then I consider the fill (vertical grey stripes). Both triangles have the same stripes. The star also has stripes, but they are alternating grey and white. ""It's the triangle with vertical grey stripes and a red outline."" That's very descriptive, but is it *necessary*?

I realize that it might not be. I think the other triangle is the key feature. The two triangles are the same except for the outline color. Therefore, ""The triangle with the red outline"" is sufficient to distinguish the target from the other visible objects.

The question of what's behind the curtain is crucial. Could there be another red triangle? That's the main uncertainty. But, given the constraints of the game, I need to use the information that I have. So, given the visible objects, I can be as specific as possible. The fill seems redundant.

I want the *best description* – concise but clear. Let's compare the two triangles. They are identical except for outline color. Therefore, mentioning the outline color is the key point. The other objects are easily distinguished by shape, color, etc. The comparison leads me to formulate the following descriptions:

1.  ""It's the triangle with the red outline.""
2.  ""There are two triangles with vertical stripes; I want you to select the one with the red outline.""
3.  ""It's the red triangle with vertical grey stripes inside.""

The first description is the most concise: ""The triangle with the red outline."" is good. ""The red triangle"" is a bit less precise but likely works. ""The triangle with vertical stripes and a red outline"" is good as well. The key here is the outline. 

The most salient features are the shape (triangle) and the outline color (red). The fill is less important. ""The triangle with a red outline"" is perfect. It's concise and clearly distinguishes it from the green-outlined triangle. ""The triangle with the red outline."" seems the best. It's the winning description.
"
exp2_079.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,"circle, circular",green,dot,"3,2",The object is a circle that is filled with grey dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the goal is to describe an object on a grid so the listener can pick it out. I need to be precise, as there are multiple distractors. First, I'm analyzing the target. It's a circle, with a green outline, and filled with a pattern of grey dots on a white background. I see a dashed red box around it, but the listener doesn't, so that's irrelevant.

Next, I'm looking at the other objects. Several have grey dots, so ""grey dots"" alone won't be enough. There's a square with grey dots, two stars with grey dots, and another circle but with wavy lines. So shape and outline color are also important differentiating features.

Now, I'm formulating descriptions. It has a green outline, and no other object shares that outline color, which is a strong, unique feature. The other circle is the biggest potential distractor as it shares the ""circle"" shape, but it has a blue outline and a wavy lines fill.

I'm considering a few options. Option 1: ""The object has a green outline."" It's simple and seems sufficient. Option 2: ""Select the circle that is filled with grey dots."" This is unique too because the other circle has waves. Option 3, for robustness: ""The object is a circle with a green outline, and it's filled with grey dots.""

Simplicity is often best, so ""The object has a green outline"" and ""The circle with grey dots"" are great contenders. Since ""The green outline"" is such a direct and simple way to identify it, I would lean toward this option.

I'm revisiting the potential descriptions.
Shape is a circle. The outline is green. The fill is grey dots. Only one object shares the shape ""circle"" but it has a different fill. And only one object has the green outline. I can get away with just ""the object with the green outline.""
But, to make it clear what is unique, I can also say ""the circle filled with dots.""

Let's do a final check. Target: a green-outlined, grey-dotted circle. The closest distractor is a blue-outlined, wavy-lined circle. ""The circle with the dots"" works. The other dotted objects are all different shapes, so ""the dotted circle"" is also clear. I'm focusing on ""the circle with the dots"" as it feels the most descriptive.

So, the simplest and clearest instruction would be: ""The circle filled with grey dots."" It's unique and specific enough. No other object fits that description.
"
exp2_080.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,"triangle, triangular",blue,dot,"2,3",Select the blue triangle that's filled with grey dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being asked to play a reference game. I need to describe this object in a way that *uniquely* identifies it, and I'm assuming the person I'm describing it to *can* see the hidden objects as well. That means I can't rely on spatial cues or vague descriptors. I have to be precise. Let's analyze.

First, I've got to break down the visible elements. I see a 3x3 grid, and in that grid, I need to identify the target object. Here's what's visible: there are two squares with red curtains and question marks, so I can't describe what is behind them. Next, there is a square with a checkerboard pattern and a thick blue border, and finally, a black-outlined star with a checkerboard pattern.

The object I need to describe is a triangle with a blue outline, filled with small grey dots. Those are the defining features. Now, how do I differentiate this target from the other visible elements?

The star is a totally different shape (a star, not a triangle), has a different fill (a checkerboard, not dots), and a different outline color (black, not blue). The checkerboard square, while it shares the blue outline, is still a square. The dots are the key distinguishing feature and the blue outline is a useful secondary feature. The fact the other person can see behind the curtains is a crucial constraint. So, I have to be super clear on the visible objects.

Now, considering the hidden objects, I have to assume the other person knows what's behind those curtains. Could there be another triangle? Another object with a blue outline? Another object filled with dots? Potentially.

If there's another triangle, I'd need to specify the fill (grey dots) or the blue outline. If there's another object with dots, I must specify the shape (triangle) or the blue outline. And if there's another blue outline, I must also say triangle or the grey dots.

To ensure clarity, I need to combine those unique features. The safest option seems to be to leverage the unique attributes. So, I need to be as precise as possible, while also making the description simple.

I could say, ""Select the triangle that has a blue border and is filled with grey dots."" The shape and fill seem like the most distinct features. But, can I make this more concise? ""The triangle filled with grey dots"" is probably sufficient, but how do I get more precise? The blue outline provides extra information. So, ""The blue triangle filled with dots"" is also a good choice. Or even: ""The object shaped like a triangle, with a blue border and grey polka dots inside."" A bit wordy, but clear.

Let's break this down further. Shape: triangle (unique), Fill: Grey dots (unique), Outline: Blue (shared with the blue square, but the triangle shape makes it uniquely the target object). ""The blue triangle filled with dots."" That feels like the winning combination. The shape is specific, the dots are specific, and the blue outline is specific too. It covers all key features. I'm going to check one more time though, the star has a checkerboard fill and black outline. The square has a blue outline and a checkerboard fill. My description hits all the markers, the ""blue triangle filled with dots"". This description is simple, accurate, and unlikely to be confused.

exp2_081.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,"triangle, triangular",green,checker,"2,1",The triangle with the checkerboard pattern.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I need to describe an object in this reference game. The goal is to make sure someone else can pick it out from a set of distractors. First, I need to understand what I'm looking at in that red box. It's a triangle, and a green triangle at that. Plus, the fill is a checkerboard pattern – grey and white.

Next, I need to analyze the surrounding objects. Let's see... circles with stripes and polka dots, another triangle with a wavy pattern. The key is to find something that uniquely identifies the target, and distinguishes it from the distractors.

Simply saying ""It's a triangle"" is too generic. ""It's a green triangle"" gets me closer, but the other triangle is also green. Aha! The checkerboard pattern is what sets it apart. No other object has that.

Now, let's think about how to formulate the description. I need it to be clear and robust. I can go with ""The object with the checkerboard pattern"". That's concise, but I can also incorporate the shape. So, ""The green triangle with the checkerboard pattern"" is ideal. I could also say ""The checkerboard triangle"", but ""The green triangle with the checkerboard pattern"" seems a little more robust to me. And if I am to err, I will err on the side of clarity.

Let's do a quick final check. Target: Green triangle, checkerboard fill. Other triangle: Green triangle, wavy fill. Yep, ""The green triangle with the checkerboard pattern"" clearly nails it. It's concise and unambiguous. I'm going with that!

exp2_082.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,"triangle, triangular",green,stripe,"2,1",The object is a triangle with a green outline and vertical stripes inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game. My goal is to describe a target object in an image so someone else can pick it out. I need to be precise, but also efficient. I see a 3x3 grid, some open cells, some with objects, and some hidden behind red curtains. The target is a green triangle with vertical grey and white stripes, highlighted with a red dashed box.

First, I need to understand the visual context. I see a black circle, also with vertical stripes. So, the descriptions can't be too vague, as there are other objects that share some similar properties. The listener knows what's behind the curtains, so I need to be robust to those unknowns, too.

My initial thought was, ""It's the green triangle."" But that's not specific enough. What if something else is green? Or a different triangle? That's when I had to start refining the descriptions. ""The green triangle with vertical stripes"" is better, as it gives more features. But, is it the best?

To be sure, I went through the features: triangle, green outline, and vertical stripes. Then I looked at the distractor, the circle, which has a black outline, and the same vertical stripes. I saw I need to mention both the shape and the color. The fill pattern (vertical stripes) is shared, but that is secondary to the other properties. So, ""The green triangle"" works as a minimum.

I analyzed my description further. The description ""The green triangle"" is precise enough to select the green triangle from the black circle. But, is there some unknown object that will make the description ambiguous? I realized that mentioning the shared feature is good insurance. Thus, I refined this to: ""The green triangle with vertical stripes"".

Now, I was ready to construct the description, thinking about how it would sound to the listener. First, I focused on the features: ""There's a triangle... with a green outline... and it's filled with vertical stripes."" Then I combined them: ""The green triangle filled with vertical stripes."" Next I refined it into ""The green triangle with vertical stripes.""

That's the best description because it's concise, accurate, and it distinguishes it from the distractor. The prompt told me not to use any degenerate spatial location descriptions. So, this final description is complete: ""The green triangle with vertical stripes.""

exp2_083.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,star,red,dot,"3,3",It's the star with a red border that is filled with dots.,"**My Analysis of the Reference Game**

Okay, so I'm being asked to play a reference game. My objective is to describe an object in a 3x3 grid well enough for another person to identify it. I'm seeing four objects, but I know there could be hidden ones. I can't rely on spatial locations since those are arbitrary in this context.

First, I need to analyze what's visible. The target is a star, specifically a five-pointed one, with a red border and filled with a grey dotted pattern. The distractors are a green-bordered square with vertical grey stripes, a red-bordered triangle with the same stripes, and a blue-bordered circle with a grey and white checkerboard pattern.

Next, I'm identifying the unique features of the target. Shape (star), color (red border), and fill (dotted pattern). The shape is key - it immediately narrows it down. But since the instructions say there are hidden objects, I can't just say ""the star"". The red border alone isn't enough, either, as the triangle shares that feature. And dots are the most unique attribute among the rest.

I'm thinking about the descriptions. ""Select the star"" is likely good but the instructions warn me that another hidden star could exist. ""Select the object with a dotted pattern inside"" works, too. A combination is safer: ""Select the red star with a dotted pattern inside."" That's precise.

Given the potential for hidden objects, I need to be as robust as possible. I've got to use multiple features. I want to avoid ambiguity. The constraint about not using spatial locations is also a clear one.

My thought process is: what's the most clear description that I can provide? I want to build a description that is unambiguous. I want to use all the distinctive features. So, the final utterance is: ""The object is a star with a red border that is filled with dots."" I could also say ""It's the red star filled with dots."" I'm confident that this description is specific enough, even considering the possibility of hidden objects, and that I've provided the listener with all the information they need.

exp2_084.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,"circle, circular",black,"wavy, zigzag","2,1",The circle with the black border.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game. My objective is to describe the target object within this grid so that the other player can select it, while I don't know what they can see. I've got to be precise, but also efficient. I'm looking at this 3x3 grid, and I immediately start to process the visual information. I see a highlighted target object, a circle. My focus is to create a description that uniquely identifies it. There are a few things that come into play here:

First, I analyze the image. There are empty cells, objects, and obscured cells behind a red curtain. I know the other player can see what's behind the curtain, but I can't. So I need to formulate a description that works regardless of what is behind the curtains.

Now, let's zoom in on the target. It's a circle in the top middle position of the grid with a thick black border and a grey and white wavy pattern inside. I identify the visible distractors. There's a circle with a green border and the same wavy pattern, plus a triangle with a blue border and a checkered pattern.

Now, I start thinking about the description. I need to single out the target among the visible objects. So, it's a circle, but not just any circle; it has a *black* border. The other visible circle has a green border. Boom! That's a key distinguishing characteristic. The inside pattern is the same for both circles. I could mention the pattern to be more descriptive, although it's not strictly necessary for disambiguation from the other circle. The triangle is also different, with a blue border and checkered pattern.

So, I start to formulate the description. It's a circle, and it has a black border. This will immediately disambiguate between the two circles. But, what if there's another circle with a black border hidden behind a curtain? I don't know that. But, to be safe, I could add the wavy pattern to be more specific: ""The circle with the wavy pattern inside and a black border."" I know the other player has the whole picture. So, what's the simplest description that will work in all cases? ""The circle with the black border."" It's concise. It's directly contrasting the only visible similar object, the circle with the green border.

My goal is to be effective and concise. After carefully considering the various options and the need to be robust given the uncertainty around the hidden objects, I conclude that the best approach is to lead with the shape and border color. So, the description I would give is, ""The circle with the black border."" This is the best approach to ensure unambiguous communication. I'm going with clarity and directness. That's it: the circle with the black border.

exp2_085.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,"triangle, triangular",green,"wavy, zigzag","1,2",It's the triangle with a green outline and a wavy gray and white pattern inside.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to guide the listener to the specific target object within this grid. I need to be precise, unambiguous, and efficient with my description, assuming the listener is familiar with the game's conventions.

First, I need to understand the visual context. I see a 3x3 grid with both empty and occupied cells, and some hidden behind red curtains. The target is clearly highlighted with that dashed red box, and it's in row 2, column 1. It's a triangle, outlined in green, and filled with a distinctive wavy pattern of grey and white horizontal lines.

Next, I identify the visible ""distractors"" to inform my description. The other visible object is a star, situated at row 2, column 2. This star has a black outline and vertical stripes. The hidden cells are a wildcard, meaning my description has to be comprehensive, just in case one of those hidden objects shares some visual characteristics.

Now comes the crucial part: formulating the description. I know I have to differentiate the target object from what's visible, and also anticipate what might be behind the hidden red curtains. The obvious starting point is the shape – it's a triangle, unlike the star. But I can't stop there. I have to add enough detail to make it truly unambiguous. The green outline is a key differentiator, as is the unique wavy internal pattern.

So, I'm thinking of a concise but complete description. Starting with the shape ""triangle"" is good. I need to augment this with information about the outline's color, which is a thick green line. And then I have to mention the wavy grey and white pattern within. Combining them I see this as the clearest utterance: ""It's the triangle with a green outline and a wavy gray and white pattern inside."" This avoids any ambiguity. This has robust features.

I checked my initial utterance for ambiguity. Is ""the triangle"" sufficient? Likely, yes, given the presence of the star. However, it's safer to provide more detail. I also realize that the description should be independent of any positional references, to ensure I'm not constrained by the listener's layout, and my focus must be on the object's inherent features.

My task is to provide a precise description so they choose the correct one.

First, I need to break down what I can see. I'm taking the image as my sensory data. It’s a 3x3 grid, some squares empty, some with objects, some hidden. The highlighted target is in the bottom-middle. I can tell it's a star. I notice right away that it has a solid black outline, and the inside is filled with grey dots – almost like a polka dot pattern. The background of the cell is white, but that's a common trait, so it's probably not useful.

I also see another star in the top-left cell. This is important for differentiation. It has a green outline and a grey and white wavy pattern inside. That's a good contrast. This will come in handy when I phrase my description.

Now, those red curtains. They're a wild card. I don't know what's behind them, but the listener does. It's essential not to make assumptions about the contents behind those curtains. I need to describe the object based on my perspective, being mindful that the listener has more information. There could be another star, perhaps even one that looks identical to the target. But I can't know that.

So, how do I craft the perfect utterance? I need to be precise, especially given the hidden elements. First, I identify the object type: it's a star. Next, I need to differentiate it from the other visible star. The color of the outline and the interior pattern are key. The target has a black outline and a dotted fill, while the other star has a green outline and wavy lines.

I start formulating my description. I have a few options: ""a star with a black outline,"" or ""a star filled with dots,"" or ""the star with a black outline that is filled with grey dots."" This last one is probably the most specific. I could also say ""Select the star that has a black outline and is filled with polka dots."" or, ""It's a star with a black border and a dotted pattern inside.""

I want the clearest, most concise option. I know I have to focus on the features I can see. Considering the other star, the target's black outline and polka dot pattern inside are the perfect distinguishing features. ""The star with the black outline and grey dots inside"" seems to hit the mark. It's direct, it's specific, and it immediately sets it apart from the green-outlined, wavy-lined star.

I think the best option would be: ""Select the star with the black outline and grey polka dots inside."" This should be clear and concise. This gives the listener the best chance to accurately select the target object, using the visible features I describe, with the additional knowledge they have from the hidden areas.

exp2_087.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,star,black,checker,"1,2",The star with a checkerboard pattern.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My task is to clearly describe an object from a visual grid so someone else can pick it out. I'm looking at a 3x3 grid, and there are four objects to consider.

First, I've got to break down the image: top-left is a green-bordered triangle with wavy grey, top-middle is a black-bordered star with vertical black and white stripes, middle-left (the target, indicated by the box) is a black-bordered star with a grey and white checkerboard pattern, and bottom-right is a red-bordered square with grey dots. The rest of the cells are empty.

Now, I'm zeroing in on the target: the star in the middle-left. It's crucial to identify its features: shape (star), border (black), and pattern (checkerboard, grey and white).

I've immediately identified that there's a potential distractor: the other star. That's the key challenge: how to differentiate *this* star from *that* star. The triangle and the dotted square are pretty obvious distractors, easy to separate based on their shape.

The important element is the difference in fill patterns. Both stars have a black border, but the target star has a checkerboard pattern, while the other has vertical stripes. That's my key differentiator.

So, I started drafting descriptions. ""It's a star"" is too vague, given the two stars. ""It's the star with the checkerboard pattern inside"" is much better. More descriptive, even better: ""It's the star with the black outline and a grey and white checkerboard fill."" Or, succinctly, ""The object is a star with a checkerboard pattern.""

I’ve got to think like a reference game player, which means I can't rely on spatial cues like “left,” or “below.” I need to focus on *intrinsic* properties of the object itself to create the most robust description.

Therefore, I've refined the description to uniquely identify the target using those visual characteristics. I'm double-checking now: Is it accurate? Yes. Unambiguous? Yes, because of the checkerboard pattern. Avoided location? Definitely.

Therefore, the best utterance is something like, “The star with the checkerboard pattern inside,"" or ""Select the star that has a checkerboard pattern."" I’ll go with a direct statement.
"
exp2_088.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,"circle, circular",red,checker,"3,2",The object is a circle with a red outline and a checkerboard pattern inside.,"**Analyzing the Target for Accurate Reference**

Okay, so I'm being asked to describe an object within a visual field, aiming for unambiguous identification. My immediate task is to break down the target object in the red box. The goal is to articulate enough detail for someone to *precisely* pick it out from the distractors.

First, I'm noting the properties: it's a circle, with a red outline, and a checkerboard pattern inside. I need to make sure I don't use positional cues, though.

Now I'm looking at the distractors. I see a star with blue dots, a triangle with a checkerboard, a red checkerboard star, and a blue-outlined square with wavy lines. The key is to find properties that *uniquely* define the target.

I'm starting with basic descriptions: ""It's a circle."" Not specific enough, there might be other circles. So I add the outline: ""It's a circle with a red outline."" Still not enough, as there's a red star. Now, the checkerboard pattern: ""It's a circle with a checkerboard pattern."" This *seems* good because there's only one circle, but I need to be sure.

Let me examine the combinations. ""Red circle with checkerboard"" - good, but can I get more succinct? Shape (circle) is unique in this group. Outline (red) is not. Pattern (checkerboard) is not unique. However, the *combination* of shape and either of the other properties makes it unique.

I'm refining for conciseness and clarity, so, what's the best option here? ""It's the red circle with a checkerboard pattern"" is very descriptive but might be wordy. ""The circle with a checkerboard pattern"" is sufficient, because there is only one circle. ""The red circle"" works as well.

I like to combine these features for safety. I want to convey that this object is a *circle* and has this *pattern* that it shares with the triangle and the star. I could try, ""There are three objects with checkerboard patterns, but the one I want you to select is the circle."" I could also say, ""Select the circle that has the checkerboard pattern."" That's not terrible, but a more direct approach is better.

Comparing options, I find:
*   ""The red circle with the checkerboard pattern"" - the most descriptive, with minimal ambiguity.
*   ""The circle with the checkerboard pattern"" - is sufficient, as there is only one circle.
*   ""The red circle"" - also sufficient, since the other red object is a star.

I think the best option is ""The object is a circle with a checkerboard pattern."" I believe that's clear, concise, and unambiguous. It combines the shape with a key distinguishing feature. That's what I'm going with.

exp2_089.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,4,square,black,dot,"3,3",The square is filled with a grid of grey dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing a Visual Target**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe an object in a grid so that someone else can identify it, knowing that they might see the grid differently and that some objects are hidden from my view. The immediate task is to describe the target object, which I see highlighted in the bottom right corner of this 3x3 grid. It’s a square filled with a pattern of grey dots.

First, I need to break down the visual information. The image is a 3x3 grid containing various shapes: two empty squares, two squares covered by red curtains with question marks, two stars (one blue with a checkerboard, one red with vertical stripes), and my target. The red curtains are the crucial consideration. I don't know what's behind them, but the listener does. Therefore, I need a description that *uniquely* identifies my target among the objects *I can see* and that allows the listener to resolve any ambiguity with hidden objects.

Next, I need to focus on what makes the target square distinct. It's a square shape, a grid of grey dots, a black border. I must avoid spatial descriptions because the listener might see a different arrangement. The key here is specificity, particularly concerning the internal characteristics, the dots.

I've considered several possible descriptions, weighing conciseness against clarity. ""The square with grey dots"" is simple, but might be too vague given the potential for hidden elements. ""The square filled with a grid of grey dots"" is better, emphasizing the *pattern*. The most salient visual features of the square are its shape and its pattern of dots. Therefore, it's about finding a descriptor that is sufficient.

My goal is to be precise while not adding unnecessary details. Therefore, I can eliminate descriptions that mention the black border since the stars have a border too, though it is a different color. ""The object with dots"" is the simplest and unambiguous description of the target, *among the visible objects*.

In conclusion, the best and most robust description of the target is: ""The square is filled with a grid of grey dots."" This is concise, unambiguous relative to the other visible objects, and focuses on the shape and the internal pattern. It covers shape, pattern, and color, which are the salient features. It is my final answer.

exp2_090.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,"triangle, triangular",green,dot,"3,2",The green triangle filled with grey dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to guide the listener to select a specific object within a 3x3 grid. I can see the grid, and I need to craft a description of the target, which is marked with a dashed red box. The key here is to be precise and unambiguous.

First, I analyze the visual context. I'm seeing a grid with a few objects: the target (a green triangle with grey dots), a green circle with grey vertical stripes, and two red curtains with white question marks. The curtains are ""mystery boxes"" – I don't know what's behind them, but the listener does. I have to proceed on the assumption that what they see is different from my view.

My core task: describe the target object so the listener *can select the object I'm seeing* among other possibilities.

Now, my strategy is clear: I need to isolate the defining features of the target object and distinguish it from the distractors.

Let's break down the target: It's a triangle with a green outline, and it's filled with grey dots. Simple enough. Now I consider the distractors. I have the green circle with grey stripes and the two mystery boxes. I can't directly use the mystery boxes, since the listener has access to a different view.

I'm starting to think about my description, I'll think about key features. The shape is the strongest differentiator (triangle vs. circle). The fill pattern is another crucial aspect (dots vs. stripes). The outline color is the same (green), so I'm not prioritizing that. I'm focusing on features that make the object unique. I need to be concise, yet specific.

Now I'm creating a description. I could lead with the shape. I could say ""It's a triangle."" But is that sufficient? There could be another triangle hiding. ""It has a green outline"" could work as well, but again it is not enough. The best strategy is to lead with the shape, and then the key features.

The most robust description seems to combine the shape, color, and fill: ""A green triangle filled with grey dots."" This is clear, concise, and incorporates all the distinctive features, and is robust to the listener having another object that I don't see. I think that is it!
"
exp2_091.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,square,black,"wavy, zigzag","2,1",The square with the black border.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the goal is to describe a target object in an image so that someone else can identify it. I need to be precise and avoid ambiguity. Let's break this down.

First, I see a 3x3 grid with four visible objects. My focus is on the object highlighted by the red dashed box. It's a square with a thick black border, and the inside is filled with a grey wavy line pattern.

Now, I'll analyze the other objects (the distractors) to differentiate them from the target: a blue triangle with a checkerboard pattern, a green triangle also with a checkerboard pattern, and a green circle with the same grey wavy line pattern as the target. I need to pinpoint the unique features of the target.

*   **Shape:** It's a square. Bingo! There's no other square in the image, so that's a key distinguishing characteristic.
*   **Border Color:** It has a black border. Again, unique! No other object shares this.
*   **Fill Pattern:** The grey wavy line pattern. This isn't unique, because the green circle also has this.

Location is out - I need a description that would work regardless of how the image is arranged.

So, the key features are ""square"" and ""black border"".

Now I need to formulate the best description. ""The square"" is concise and unambiguous. ""The object with the black border"" is also equally strong. Combining features might be even more robust. ""The black square with a wavy pattern"" is another option, though possibly more verbose.

Let's consider possible descriptions: ""Select the square"" is very good. ""Select the object with the black border"" is also great. ""Select the square with the wavy pattern inside"" is another valid choice.

Since the other shapes have a different pattern, the target description will be clear to the listener.

The simplest, most direct descriptions are often best. Focusing on what is unique, I should stick with shape and border color. ""The square"" is extremely effective. ""The object with the black border"" also works perfectly.

If I combine features, I could say ""the square with the black border."" This is unambiguous, but maybe slightly redundant. It is clear and can't be mistaken for the circle.

I'll think through potential misunderstandings. If I just say ""the object with the wavy pattern,"" it could be confused with the circle. If I say ""the grey object,"" that's completely useless.

So, I need to mention shape and/or the black border. The shape and border is clear. ""The square with the black border"" is good.

""The square"" is simple, effective, and direct. ""The black border"" is also simple and effective. ""The shape is a square with a wavy pattern inside"" is very clear.

I will stick with ""The square with the black border."" This is very specific and cannot be confused with any other object.

exp2_092.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,"triangle, triangular",red,dot,"1,3",The triangle with the polka dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the goal is clear: I need to describe this object so someone else can pick it out from the grid. This is a reference game. I'm presented with a 3x3 grid, and there's a target object highlighted by a dashed red box. My task is to describe this target object so that the other person can identify it correctly.

First, I need to *understand* what I'm looking at. Let's break down the image: it's a 3x3 grid with four objects. I have a clear visual representation of each object, so I need to analyze their key characteristics.

*   **The Target:** It's a triangle with a red outline, and the inside has a pattern of grey polka dots. It is located in the bottom-left of the grid. But, I cannot use the grid position.
*   **Distractor 1:** Another triangle, but this one has a black outline and a grey and white checkerboard pattern filling the interior. It's in the top-right of the grid.
*   **Distractor 2:** A star with a red outline and grey polka dots. It is in the middle-right.
*   **Distractor 3:** A square with a green outline and grey polka dots. It is in the bottom-center.

Now, let's figure out what makes the target object *unique*. I have to identify the distinguishing characteristics. Shape? Color? Pattern? I must identify the essential features that differentiate it from the distractors.

Let's consider the following features one by one: Shape, Outline Color, and Fill Pattern:

*   **Shape:** It's a triangle, but there's another triangle! This means ""the triangle"" isn't enough; it's ambiguous.
*   **Outline color:** The outline is red. But the star is also red. So, ""the object with a red outline"" isn't unique either.
*   **Fill pattern:** It has grey polka dots. The star and square also have polka dots. ""The object with the polka dots"" is not enough.

I need to *combine* features for a unique description. Let's see what works:

*   ""The red triangle"" - Bingo! Only one red triangle. This is a possibility.
*   ""The polka-dotted triangle"" - This is also a good choice. There's only one triangle with that specific polka dot pattern.
*   ""The triangle with the red outline"" - Again, this differentiates it.
*   ""The red object that is a triangle"" - Excellent and precise.

Let's eliminate any potential ambiguity. Considering the hidden object constraint is not applicable here. Similarly, I must avoid using degenerate spatial locations, such as saying ""bottom-left.""

Therefore, based on this, the best concise descriptions are either:

*   ""The red triangle.""
*   ""The polka-dotted triangle.""

Both are very simple and effective. It really depends which feature is most salient to differentiate the object.

Let's choose the best one. Both the shape and pattern are critical. I could say ""the red triangle"" is perfectly unique since the other triangle is black. I could say ""the polka-dotted triangle"" is perfectly unique since the other triangle has a checkerboard pattern. Both work well!

So, which is *better*? Let's go with ""the polka-dotted triangle."" I prefer it because while the target triangle shares the color red with a star, the grey polka dots are unique to it as the differentiating feature compared to the checkerboard pattern on the other triangle.

Therefore, for this reference game, my description will be: ""The triangle with the polka dots.""

exp2_093.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,square,red,"wavy, zigzag","3,2",Select the square with the grey and white wavy pattern.,"**Analyzing the Image and Formulating a Description**

Alright, the task is a reference game. I need to describe a target object in this 3x3 grid so the listener can identify it. First, I need to analyze the input. The grid consists of several objects including my target, and I need to formulate a description based on what I can see, taking into consideration what the listener knows. The target object, a square, is highlighted for me. Inside, it has a grey background with a white, wavy line pattern, framed by a solid red border. There's another visible square with a thick black border and a grid of grey dots on a light grey/white background. The rest are empty or behind red curtains, so their contents are unknown to me. The constraints are that I can't use location-based descriptions and that I must consider hidden objects, so my description needs to be unambiguous even if there's something similar hidden.

My approach is to zero in on unique features. The target's features are: a square shape, a red solid border, and a pattern of grey and white wavy lines. The visible distractor has a square shape, a black thick border, and a dotted pattern. Border color, pattern type and the color of the pattern itself will be key differentiators. I'm focusing on features that are unlikely to be repeated among the hidden objects. A combination of features creates the most robust description.

Now I'm strategizing the best approach. ""The object with the wavy pattern"" is simple, but might be ambiguous. ""The object with the red border"" is also simple, but the same concern applies. ""The square with a red border and a grey and white wavy pattern inside"" is very specific and less likely to be confused, but it's a bit long. Should I try to keep it simple, or be more precise? ""The square with the wavy pattern"" is concise. Considering it has to be parseable and quick, I'll go with this as the starting point. It's a key distinctive feature.

To make it even more specific, I'll add the color information: ""The square with the grey and white wavy line pattern."" Now I want to determine if there is a more ideal option. ""The square with the red border"" is also a strong descriptor. This is a very good alternative. Combining features is best. I want to describe the object as simply and unambiguously as possible. The two visible patterns are a key distinction: wavy vs. dotted. The border colors are also distinct: red vs. black. Let's combine the most salient features: the pattern and the border color.

I'll refine the description to be the most concise, but effective. ""The square with a pattern of wavy grey and white lines,"" that would work, too. Now I'll compare the target to the visible distractor. My final description must be clear, concise, and differentiate it from the dotted pattern of the other visible object. ""The square with the grey and white wavy pattern,"" that sounds right. ""The square filled with grey and white wavy lines"" might be better. And, ""The square that has a pattern of grey and white wavy lines."" The border might be the key to it. I'll go with the description of the pattern. It's the most prominent feature. Ultimately, ""The square with the grey and white wavy pattern"" is the best. It's clear, concise and is the least ambiguous description.
"
exp2_094.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,star,green,dot,"1,3",The green star with dots inside.,"**My Thought Process for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object clearly enough that someone else can pick it out from the distractors. Let's break this down systematically.

First, the target itself. I see a star, it has a green outline, and it's filled with grey dots. It's in the bottom left, but I can't use location cues, the instructions specify this.

Next, I need to understand the distractors. I've got a circle with a green outline and vertical grey stripes; a triangle with a thick black outline and vertical grey stripes; a star with a red outline and vertical grey stripes; and a circle with a red outline and grey dots.

Now, I need to formulate a description that uniquely identifies the target. I need a combination of features that sets it apart. The word ""the"" assumes the listener already knows what I'm talking about, so it could be useful.

Let's look at shape first. It's a star, but there's another star. ""The star"" alone is ambiguous. However, I can combine this with another feature, like color.

The outline color is green. The other star is red. So, ""the green star"" is a potentially good description. I'll need to check the other green objects and fill patterns, though. There's also a green circle, so I'll need to use more than just color.

The fill pattern is dots. There's also a red circle with dots. The other star has stripes. ""The star with dots"" could work, but it would have to be very clear.

Now, I'll compare these potential descriptions.

""The green star"" is concise and accurate, assuming the listener can easily discriminate color.

""The star with dots"" is also concise, and unambiguous.

""The green object with dots"" is more verbose, but precise. The other green object has stripes. The other object with dots is red. This works.

I need to consider the listener. They might not have the same visual arrangement, so location is out. The goal is clarity.

So, I'm thinking, ""The green star"" is simple and effective and ""The star with dots"" is also simple and effective. ""The green star filled with dots"" is very descriptive and leaves no room for ambiguity.

I'm leaning towards ""The star with dots."" It's efficient and unambiguous.

Let's analyze the properties again and choose the best description:

*   Target: shape=star, color=green, fill=dots
*   Distractor 1: shape=circle, color=green, fill=stripes
*   Distractor 2: shape=triangle, color=black, fill=stripes
*   Distractor 3: shape=star, color=red, fill=stripes
*   Distractor 4: shape=circle, color=red, fill=dots

To differentiate from the red star, I can use color or fill. To differentiate from the green circle, I can use shape or fill. To differentiate from the red circle, I can use shape or color.

""The green star"" uniquely identifies the target.

*   It's a star, which differentiates it from the circles and the triangle.
*   It's green, which differentiates it from the other star (which is red).

""The star with dots"" also uniquely identifies the target.

*   It's a star, which differentiates it from the circles and the triangle.
*   It has dots, which differentiates it from the other star (which has stripes).

Both are excellent, but I will choose one. ""The green star with dots."" Or ""The star with dots."" since there is only one star with dots. Let's go with that. It's concise and unambiguous.

Let's re-evaluate. Is ""the star with dots"" the best?

Compare it with ""the green star"".

Both seem equally good.

Let's check the combinations.

*   Green things: a circle and a star. So ""the green star"".
*   Dotted things: a circle and a star. So ""the dotted star"" or ""the star with dots"".

The description should be as efficient as possible while remaining unambiguous. ""The star with dots"" seems very clear. The listener looks for a star, finds two, and then checks the fill pattern. One has stripes, one has dots. Perfect. ""The green star"" seems equally clear. The listener looks for a star, finds two, and then checks the outline color. One is red, one is green. Perfect.

Let's consider another option. ""The object with a green outline and a dotted fill"".

*   Green"
exp2_095.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,"circle, circular",blue,dot,"1,3",The object filled with dots.,"**My Thought Process: Deciphering the Reference Game**

Okay, the task is to act as a ""speaker"" in a reference game. I need to describe a target object in an image so a listener can identify it. First, I'll break down the image. It's a 3x3 grid, but only three cells are populated.

**Phase 1: Analysis and Identification**

I can see three objects: a square with a green border and checkerboard fill (top right), a triangle with a blue border and checkerboard fill (middle left), and a circle with a blue border and a dotted pattern (bottom left). The target is clearly the circle with the dotted pattern, highlighted by a red dashed box. No hidden objects or tricks here, according to instructions.

**Phase 2: Distractor Analysis & Description**

Now, I analyze the distractors (the square and triangle) to build the best description. The square has a different shape and color, and a checkerboard pattern, so it's clearly distinct. The triangle shares the blue border with the circle but has a different shape and checkerboard pattern.

I must craft a description that is unique and unambiguous. I should avoid positional terms, focusing instead on inherent visual features.

**Phase 3: Crafting and Evaluating Descriptions**

I start brainstorming descriptions: ""The circle,"" a good starting point as it is unique; ""The object with dots,"" also unique given the other objects; ""The blue circle,"" also works; ""The object with a blue border and a dotted pattern,"" is precise, but maybe too wordy. I can combine shape and pattern with ""The circle with the dotted pattern.""

**Phase 4: Optimization and Choosing the Best Description**

Simplicity and clarity are key. ""The circle"" or ""The object with dots"" should be enough. I compare these. The shape (circle) is a very primary feature. The pattern (dots) is also very distinct. Both are excellent choices. I rule out ""the blue one"" as the triangle also has a blue border. Shape and fill pattern are the most salient features. The circle is simpler than the others. I will use the dots as the primary feature because it's a very distinct feature compared to the checkerboard pattern on the other two objects. It feels more descriptive than just saying ""the circle"".

**Phase 5: Refinement**

The description must be concise and easily understood. Now, I will re-examine the features to make sure that the description uniquely describes the object.

-Shape: The target is the only circle.
-Pattern: The target is the only one with dots.
-Border Color: The target is one of two objects with a blue border.

Either shape (""the circle"") or pattern (""the one with dots"") is good. Color (""the blue one"") is ambiguous.

**Final Phase: Decision**

""The circle"" or ""The object with dots"" is the simplest and best description. The dot pattern is a strong distinguishing feature.

I'll finalize on ""The object with dots inside"". It is short, concise, and unambiguously identifies the target. Alternatively, ""The circle with the dotted pattern"" is very good too. Let's go with the pattern as it stands out strongly. The difference between dots and a checkerboard is stark.

Final Decision: ""The object filled with dots."" That's the one.

exp2_096.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,star,green,dot,"1,3",The star with the green outline and dots inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing a Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe an object in a grid so well that someone else can identify it. Here's how I'm approaching this, step-by-step:

First, I need to understand the visual context. I see a 3x3 grid, some empty cells, and some occupied by objects. Two cells are hidden by curtains, but the listener can see those cells. The visible objects are a triangle with a red outline, a circle with a black outline, a blue star, and the target object: a star with a green outline and a dotted pattern inside.

Next, I identify the target: the green star. Okay, that's clear. Now I need to consider the *distractors* – the other objects. There's another star, a circle, a triangle, and two unknowns behind the curtains.

Now, I start formulating my description. The shape is a star, but there's another. So, I need to use another feature to distinguish it. Color seems promising – the target star has a green outline, while the other has a blue outline. The pattern is also worth mentioning. The target star and the blue star both have a dotted pattern, while the triangle and circle have a wavy pattern.

I start to construct a referring expression. ""There is a star..."" Then I add color for differentiation: ""...with a green outline."" The dotted pattern, while shared by another visible object, adds precision: ""...and a dotted pattern inside.""

I review this expression: ""The green star with dots inside."" This is concise and appears accurate. But I have to consider the unknowns. If one of the hidden objects is *also* a green star, is my description sufficient? The instructions say the listener knows what's behind the curtain. So, I need to make a description based on *visible* features.

I go back to the differentiating features. The color of the outline is the primary differentiator between the two stars (green vs. blue), and the pattern is the differentiator between the stars and other shapes (dots vs. waves). Combining these seems robust.

Now, I try to finalize it, focusing on the most salient features. It's a star. And it's green. Combining these is good. ""The green star"". Is it enough? The color alone distinguishes it from the blue star. However, to be certain, I want to use a slightly more complete description.

I want the most effective combination of shape and color. ""The star with a green outline"" seems to do it. It's simple, unambiguous, and directly contrasts with the other star. The pattern information adds a little extra clarity.

Okay, let's refine this slightly. ""The star with the green outline"" is very strong. ""The green star"" is also very good. I'll test it further. ""The object that is a star and has a green outline."" That's also good. I'll pick the most natural and clear.

I settle on: ""The star with a green outline and dots inside.""
I consider other options like: ""The green star"" is also a good choice. Is it ambiguous? No, based on what's visible. But just to be sure, I will choose something slightly more descriptive.

I've considered all the information, the colors, shapes, and patterns. And after careful consideration, I've decided: ""The star with a green outline and dots inside"". Or just: ""The green star"".

exp2_097.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,square,black,stripe,"3,2",The square with vertical stripes.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. The goal is to accurately describe the target object so the listener, who has a different perspective on the scene, can identify it. Here's how I'm thinking through this:

First, I'm taking stock of the visual input. It's a 3x3 grid, and I can see some objects, some are hidden, and the target is clearly marked. My immediate instinct is to break down the visible elements: the grid layout, the white spaces, and the items I *can* see. The red curtains are a wildcard, but the listener holds that information. Crucially, I have a red dashed box pointing to my target, which is in the middle row, rightmost column.

Next, I'm focusing on the target object itself. I can see that it's a square with a distinct black border and vertical stripes inside. The stripes alternate grey and white. I'm noting this meticulously.

Now I'm scanning the distractors - the visible objects in the grid: the red-outlined star with similar grey and white stripes, the blue-outlined star with grey dots, and the red curtains with the question marks. These distractors are crucial. My description needs to uniquely identify the target object.

I need to come up with a description that's both accurate and concise. The obvious starting point is the most immediate features: it's a square and it has vertical stripes. But here's where the comparison kicks in. There's another object with vertical stripes – the star. Therefore, I need to mention the shape. The shape is the key to differentiating it from the star. The striped pattern is also valuable since the dotted star does not have stripes, nor would I assume the objects behind the curtain do. So, I’m thinking ""a square with vertical stripes"".

Now I’m anticipating the unknown. I'm considering what could be behind those curtains. I don’t know. I’m thinking that even if there was another square behind the curtains, let’s say with horizontal stripes, my description, ""a square with vertical stripes"" would still be unique. If there were another square with vertical stripes, but of different colors, my description could be more specific: ""a square with grey and white vertical stripes"". However, since I can't see behind the curtains, I need to be as specific as possible about the *visible* features to ensure my description is robust.

After all of this, the final check comes. Can I make this clearer or more effective? ""The square with vertical grey and white stripes."" Is there any ambiguity? The ""square"" part ensures that it’s not confused with the stars, and the “grey and white vertical stripes” element differentiates it from all other objects in the grid. However, perhaps I can simplify and still maintain uniqueness. Going with ""The square with vertical stripes."" would be sufficient to differentiate it from all of the visible distractors. This is concise and accurate, and it's independent of the location on the grid.

Therefore, the final utterance will be something along the lines of ""The square with vertical stripes."" Clear, concise, and hopefully, unambiguous from the listener's perspective.

exp2_098.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,square,blue,stripe,"1,2",The square with the blue outline has vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with playing a speaker in this reference game. My goal is clear: describe the highlighted target object so that it can be unambiguously identified by another participant. The fact that I'm an expert in this task is key: I need to be efficient and precise.

First, I need to analyze the scene. I see a 3x3 grid with a few objects visible. It looks like a square and two stars. The target is a blue-outlined square with vertical stripes. I can't assume the listener sees the grid in the same way I do, so I can't use positional descriptors like ""left"" or ""middle."" Plus, there's a possibility of hidden objects.

Next, I need to break down the key features. The target is a square, it has a blue outline, and it has vertical stripes inside. The distractors are stars with different colors and patterns. The square shape feels pretty unique in this context, and the pattern of vertical stripes is clearly distinct from the wavy and checkerboard patterns.

The hidden object is the wild card. I need to be *sure* my description is precise enough to select the object even if the hidden object is similar. I can't just say ""the square"" if there's potentially another square. I have to combine the features to give a robust description.

Therefore, I need to come up with a description that will distinguish this square from the stars, and potentially any hidden objects.

So, I start thinking about what to say. ""The square"" is a good start, but it's not enough. ""The blue square"" also isn't enough, since there are blue stars. What about ""The object with vertical stripes?"" Better, but still not enough. However, I can combine: ""The square with vertical stripes!"" That's good.

I need to make it as specific as I can. So, I will focus on the shape, color, and pattern. ""The square with the blue outline and vertical stripes"" is probably best. If there's another square, it won't have those properties. If there's another striped object, it won't be a square.

Now, I start to refine the phrasing. I want to be both accurate and natural. ""The square with vertical stripes"" is a good concise choice. Adding the border's color ""The square with a blue border and grey vertical stripes"" is even more detailed. I need to pick one sentence.

Let me think. Let's make sure it's the most unambiguous. The most important feature is the shape and the pattern. Let's make it easy to understand. I'll make it short. So, I need to combine those unique features. That's the best approach. ""The square with vertical stripes"" is great. I also need to make sure to mention the color.

So, let's keep it simple. ""The square with the blue border has vertical stripes."" Yep, that's clear, concise, and should be easily understood. If I say it out loud, that's what I'll say. And that's it!

exp2_099.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,"circle, circular",green,"wavy, zigzag","2,3",The circle with the wavy pattern inside.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to give a description of a target object within this 3x3 grid that's so precise that the listener can identify it without any ambiguity. I need to be efficient and accurate, focusing on features that differentiate it from the other objects in the grid.

First, I take a look at the image and quickly process what I see. There are four objects in total across the grid. The object I need to describe is the one highlighted by the dashed red box. It's a circle with a green border, and inside it is a grey wavy pattern.

Now, the real work begins. I've got to make sure my description stands out from all the distractors:

*   **Object 1:** A square, green border, and grey wavy pattern.
*   **Object 2:** A circle, blue border, and grey vertical stripes.
*   **Object 3:** A star, red border, and grey vertical stripes.

I begin by comparing the target object's features with all the other objects in the image. I realize ""The circle with the wavy pattern"" is probably the most useful as it leverages two features to distinguish the target. The wavy pattern would also be an option, but the square also has this characteristic.

I need to come up with the most concise description that will still be precise. I consider options:

*   ""The green circle""
*   ""The circle with a wavy pattern""
*   ""The circle with the green outline""

I quickly realize ""The circle"" isn't enough, there are other circles. ""The green object"" isn't unique either, there's a green square. ""The object with the wavy pattern"" is too vague, given the square. So, I need to combine features. I've got to make sure it uniquely identifies the target, and that nothing else in the image shares that exact combination of features. ""The green circle"" works, the other circle is blue, and the other green object is a square.

Finally, I land on ""The circle with the wavy pattern"". It feels robust and clear. I check to make sure that the image doesn't include another wavy object. I confirm that the object is unique and the description is short, sufficient, and natural.

exp2_100.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,square,green,dot,"3,2",Select the square with the green border that is filled with grey dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My goal is to describe a target object so another person can identify it, even though they can't see the red dashed box *I* see highlighting it. They also don't have the same perspective, and there are potentially hidden objects. I need to be precise and avoid location-based descriptions. Let's break this down.

First, I analyze what's visible. I'm looking at a 3x3 grid. I can see two objects, and two are hidden behind red curtains. The immediate thing that stands out is the target object: It's a square with a green border and a pattern of grey dots in a grid. The other visible object is also a square with a green border, but it's a checkerboard pattern.

The critical thing is to create a description that uniquely identifies the target, given the other visible object and the possibility of other objects being behind the curtains. I can't rely on position, so I have to focus on the *features* of the target.

I need to make this clear. The checkerboard is the obvious contrast here. I'm going to focus on the dot pattern as the key differentiator.

So my initial thought is: ""Select the object that has a pattern of grey dots inside."" This seems unambiguous, given the checkerboard present.

But what if something similar is hidden? The instructions tell me that they know what is behind the curtain, so it would be easy to disambiguate from my perspective.

Considering this, I need to make the description *specific*. The dots are grey, and they're arranged in a grid. I'm also seeing a green border, and I see a square shape.

So I think, ""It's a square with a green border, and inside there's a pattern of grey dots."" The other object is the checkerboard, so that helps.

I start refining the description: ""The object is a square. It has a green frame/border. The content is a grid of grey dots."" So, the difference is the *content* of the square. That's what matters.

Possible descriptions: ""The square with the grey dots."" or ""Select the object that is a square with a green border filled with grey dots."" Or, ""It's the square containing a grid of grey circles."" I think ""dots"" is fine. ""Grid of grey dots"" is good, too, because I'm including the arrangement.

I consider potential ambiguities. Are hidden objects different colors? Borders? Different dot arrangements?

So, I decide to be as specific as possible: ""Select the square with a solid green border that contains a grid of grey dots on a white background."" It's very specific, but is it too long?

I can shorten it: ""The square with the green border that has grey dots inside."" I think that's sufficient, but is there anything else?

Let's simplify again. The dot pattern is the differentiator, so ""The object with the grey dots arranged in a grid."" I don't need to specify the square, or border, since the other visible object shares those features. But, just to be safe, I'm going to include the details.

""It's a square with a green border and a pattern of grey dots inside."" I think it's solid, and it contrasts with the checkerboard.

Now, let's re-evaluate: Square, green border, grey dots in a grid. The other object: Square, green border, grey/white checkerboard. The grey dots differentiate.

My description: ""Select the object that has grey dots inside it."" is probably enough. ""It's a square with a green border"" might also be good to include as well.

I'll finalize on: ""Select the square with the green border that is filled with grey dots."" It's simple and covers the features: shape, border, and content. I think that is perfect.

exp2_101.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,"circle, circular",green,checker,"3,3",Select the circle that contains a checkerboard pattern.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object within this grid so that someone else can identify it. I need to be precise, but also efficient in my description.

First, I've got to break down the image. It's a 3x3 grid, nine cells in total. Some cells are empty, but the key things here are the objects. Two cells have red curtains with question marks; I can't know what's behind them. However, there are two visible circles with green outlines and different internal patterns. The target is one of these circles, highlighted by the red box.

So, the target object is one of two circles, both with green outlines. Crucially, the target has a *checkerboard* pattern inside. The other circle has vertical stripes. The curtains are a factor I can’t account for, so I'll focus on the visible items. I want to describe the target clearly and uniquely, focusing on the differences between these two circles. The green outlines are shared, so that’s less important for differentiating.

I’m drafting a few possible utterances: ""Select the circle with a checkerboard pattern inside."" This is direct and unambiguous. ""It's a circle with a green outline and a checkerboard pattern."" This adds the color, giving a bit more context. Then there is “There are two circles with green outlines. Pick the one that has a checkered pattern, not the one with stripes.” Or I could say: ""The object is a circle with a green border. Inside the circle, there's a grey and white checkerboard pattern.""

I want to be concise, but clear. I'm thinking, combining the shape, outline and internal pattern would be best. The checkerboard pattern is the most unique. So, combining features I’d go with ""The circle with a green outline that has a checkerboard pattern inside.""

I need to make sure the description doesn't rely on spatial location, which could change. My description should uniquely identify the target among the *visible* objects. I can’t account for the hidden objects, so I need to make my description as specific as possible to the visible items. I want to be *sure*.

So, a few more tweaks, maybe: ""Select the circle with the checkerboard pattern."" That's simple and effective. Or, ""It's a green-outlined circle with a checkered pattern inside."" My focus needs to be on the pattern first. I am leaning towards something that mentions the pattern first as it's the most unique feature.

So, either ""The object has a checkerboard pattern inside a circle with a green outline."" Or a direct instruction: ""Select the circle that contains a checkerboard pattern.""

The key here is that the other visible circle has vertical stripes. As long as the hidden ones *aren't* also a circle with a checkerboard pattern, this will work. Since I can’t see behind the curtains, I can’t account for that; so I need to be as robust as possible describing what *is* visible. I think I'll go with the more concise, direct command: ""Select the circle that contains a checkerboard pattern."" That should be the most effective.

exp2_102.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,square,black,checker,"3,1",It's the square with the checkerboard pattern.,"**My Thought Process: Describing a Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game and need to describe this target object so that someone else, who may have a different view, can identify it. I'm given a visual grid and told a red dashed box marks the object I need to describe. I need to make the description precise, and account for the possibility of hidden objects, which are indicated by a red curtain. I must ignore the position in the grid, as the listener's perspective might be different.

First, I analyze the target. It's a square, with a black outline and a grey/white checkerboard fill. I then look at the other objects, the distractors. There's a blue triangle with a checkerboard fill, a red triangle with a wavy fill, a blue circle with a wavy fill, and a green triangle with a checkerboard fill.

The goal is a description that *uniquely* identifies the target. Initially, I think of ""the square"" because it's the only square visible. Then I consider ""the one with the black outline"" as that's also unique. ""The one with the checkerboard pattern"" is not enough, as there are other shapes with this pattern. But, the combination is unique.

I consider the simplest option first. ""The square"" is concise and initially seems perfect. But what if there are hidden objects? The game instructions tell me to account for hidden objects, and not assume what is visible is all that exists.

I then revisit the potential for hidden objects, which means a single descriptive feature might fail. If there is a hidden square, I am going to have to use a more complex description.

A better description is the shape and pattern. I can say ""the square with the checkerboard pattern"". If there is another hidden square, or another hidden shape with a checkerboard, it still will not be confusing. I also like ""the black-outlined square"".

So I start exploring combining features, ""The square with the checkerboard pattern."" or ""The square with the black outline."" I think the safest choice that can still be concise is ""The square with the checkerboard pattern."" It's specific enough to handle any hidden objects while remaining relatively straightforward. I also consider ""the square with the black outline.""

Ultimately, I settle on *choosing a description using a combination of shape and feature.* I've decided to describe it as ""the square that has a checkerboard pattern inside."" This avoids any ambiguity that could arise from single-feature descriptions if hidden objects are present.

exp2_103.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,square,red,dot,"2,1",It's the square with gray dots in it.,"**My Thought Process in Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with acting as the speaker in a reference game. My objective is clear: to describe a target object in such a way that another person can identify it correctly from a set of distractors. This is essentially a problem of effective communication under constraints. I need to be precise and avoid ambiguity.

First, I need to analyze the visual data. It's a 3x3 grid. The target object, which is what I need to describe, is in the top-middle cell. It's a square with a white background and a grid of gray dots inside, delineated by a red, dashed border. *Critically*, I must ignore that border because the other person won't see it. This means I'm concentrating on the square's content, the dots, and the square itself.

Now, I look at the surrounding objects in the grid: there's a red curtain with a question mark, a circle with gray dots, and empty white squares. I need to distinguish my target from these. The circle with gray dots is the most similar distractor.

The key to a good description will be the differentiating characteristic. I need to pinpoint the essential difference between the target and the distractors. Clearly, it's the *shape* that sets the target apart: It's a square. The dots are common to the target and the circular distractor.

I started formulating a description. ""It's the square with gray dots inside."" This sounds concise and accurate. It directly contrasts with the ""circle with gray dots."" Mentioning the grid pattern of the dots might be redundant, but specifying the container shape of ""square"" is crucial. Importantly, I should avoid any locational references like ""top row,"" since the layout of the objects might vary in future scenarios.

I had several draft descriptions: ""It's a square filled with a grid of gray dots."" ""The object is a square with gray dots inside it."" ""Select the square that has gray dots in it."" All of them are viable. The simplest option, ""It's the square with gray dots in it,"" seems the most direct and effective.

To finalize, I re-evaluated. The target is a square with gray dots. The most similar distractor is a circle with gray dots. The description has to distinguish the target from this circle and the other, irrelevant distractors. My final description is: ""It's the square with gray dots in it."" This focuses on the essential characteristics: shape and content. This will unambiguously point the listener to the correct object. It is, therefore, the most effective description.
"
exp2_104.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,2,"circle, circular",green,stripe,"2,3",The circle with vertical stripes.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to guide a listener to identify a specific object within a 3x3 grid, a single target object that's highlighted, and avoid any ambiguity. I can't use spatial locations.

First, I had to thoroughly *analyze* the visual information. I noted the presence of three distinct objects: a circle with wavy lines, the *target*—a circle with vertical stripes, and a star with vertical stripes. I immediately pinpointed the target, which, luckily, the system highlighted for me.

The core of my approach is *identification*. I need to focus on what makes the target unique. The object is a circle. Other items are a star. The internal pattern is the key differentiator. The other circle has wavy stripes. The star has vertical stripes.

I then started *formulating* candidate descriptions. ""It's a circle with vertical stripes"" immediately stood out. It's concise and hits the distinguishing features: shape and pattern. ""It's the green-bordered circle with vertical stripes"" is fine but slightly more verbose. I also considered alternatives that explicitly reference the distractors, like ""It's one of the two objects with vertical stripes, the one that is a circle.""

Of course, I had to keep a *few constraints* in mind. No degenerate spatial locations (""the one on the bottom""). I'm keeping the possible presence of other objects in mind when creating my descriptions, even if they aren't visible, so as to not create ambiguity if they were present.

Ultimately, I *selected* the best description. ""The circle with vertical stripes"" is a winner. It's precise. It addresses shape. It addresses the unique pattern. It's an unambiguous, elegant solution. ""The circle that has vertical stripes inside"" is a little more explicit but still robust. The target is a circle. It has vertical stripes. It's the most robust description. I'm going with ""The circle with vertical stripes"".

exp2_105.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,"triangle, triangular",black,dot,"2,1",Select the triangle that is filled with dots.,"**My Thought Process in Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to guide someone to identify a specific object in a 3x3 grid. I'm given an image and need to formulate a precise description. Let's break this down.

First, I need to analyze the scene. I see a 3x3 grid. The target object, which has a red dashed box around it, is a triangle in the top row, second from the left. This triangle has a thick, black border and is filled with gray dots – polka dots. The image also contains a distractor in the top-left cell: a triangle with the same border but filled with vertical gray stripes. The middle row is empty, and the bottom row is partially covered by a red curtain with white question marks. That curtain is crucial; it hides objects, meaning the description needs to be as unambiguous as possible given the available information.

Next, I have to pinpoint what distinguishes the target. Both objects I can see are triangles with thick black borders, so I can't rely on those. The *fill patterns* are the key differentiator. The target is the ""dot"" triangle. The visible distractor is the ""stripe"" triangle.

Now I formulate a description. The most obvious, and robust, way to differentiate the two is to focus on the fill pattern. I considered saying ""the triangle filled with dots"" or ""the polka-dotted triangle"" – those are good options. I also pondered how to handle the hidden objects. Since I don't know what's behind the curtain, I can't account for those hidden objects in the description. My goal should be to be unambiguous based on what is visible.

I considered a contrastive description: ""It's the triangle with dots, not the one with stripes."" But that's wordier and potentially confusing if there's *another* striped object hidden. My best option is to provide the most precise description possible based on the visible elements. If there are other ""dot"" triangles behind the curtain, that's a limitation of the information, not a failure of my description, assuming the instructions of the game are followed.

After weighing the pros and cons, the simplest and most effective description is ""The triangle filled with dots."" It's concise, accurate, and highlights the single defining feature that differentiates it from the visible distractor. It avoids any unnecessary complexity and assumes the receiver can infer the difference from what is available. So that's what I'll go with.
"
exp2_106.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,"triangle, triangular",green,dot,"2,1",It's a triangle with a green border that is filled with grey dots.,"**My Approach to the Reference Game**

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game. My task is to describe an object, the one inside the red dashed box, so someone else can identify it. I need to be precise, as if I'm not, there are distractors: a blue-outlined, dot-filled square, and a green-outlined, checkerboard triangle. Also, there's a red curtain obscuring two objects below. I don't know what's hidden, but the other player does.

First, I analyzed the target. It's a triangle, with a green outline, and filled with grey dots. I've noted that it's the middle object in the top row, but I cannot refer to the box.

Now, I've got to compare it to the distractors. The blue square shares the dot pattern, but the shape and outline color are different. The other triangle shares the shape and outline color, but has a checkerboard pattern inside.

My goal is to differentiate the green triangle with grey dots from all other options.

I can't just say ""the green triangle"" because there are two. ""The shape with dots"" doesn't work either because the square has dots. I need a combination.

""The green triangle with dots inside"" seems promising. It distinguishes from both, but I've got to consider what might be behind the curtain. If the hidden objects share the same characteristics, my description fails. However, I can only account for what's visible, so I need to be as specific as possible. The optimal, unambiguous description for the visible objects would be, ""the green triangle filled with grey dots"". Or perhaps, ""It's a triangle with a green border and it's filled with grey dots."" More concisely, ""The green triangle filled with dots.""

Let's do a quick final check:

*   **Shape:** Triangle. Good, rules out the square.
*   **Outline color:** Green. Good, also rules out the square.
*   **Fill pattern:** Dots. Good, this rules out the checkerboard triangle.

This seems unique enough, amongst what is visible. I will go with ""The green triangle filled with dots.""

exp2_107.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,"triangle, triangular",red,"wavy, zigzag","3,3",Select the object with the red border and the wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with acting as a speaker in a reference game. My primary objective is to describe a specific object in an image clearly enough that someone else can identify it without ambiguity. Let's break this down. First, I need to *analyze* the visual scene. I see a 3x3 grid with various shapes inside. My immediate focus is on the target, which is a red triangle with a grey wavy pattern. It's highlighted by a red dashed box, so that simplifies things.

Next, I have to *identify* the specific features of the target object: It's a triangle, the outline is red, and the inner pattern consists of grey wavy lines. I need to keep in mind these properties as I will also have to *analyze the properties of the other objects* in order to differentiate the target.

I must then *compare* the target to the other objects to find distinguishing characteristics and note anything else in the visual scene that could become a distractor. The other objects are: a green star with a grey wavy pattern, a green circle with grey polka dots, a red square with a grey and white checkerboard pattern, and a green star with grey vertical stripes.

Now, the *crucial part* is crafting a description that is both accurate and *unambiguous*. I have to ensure the listener can single out the right object by considering all options. I consider all possible combinations of features. If I simply say ""the red object,"" that's not enough because there's also a red square. Similarly, ""the object with a wavy pattern"" is also ambiguous because there's also a green star with a wavy pattern.

I consider different ways to combine features and test them to see if they are unique. The best description should be the most concise and effective way to distinguish the target. For instance, ""the triangle"" would work because it's the only triangle. ""The red triangle"" is also good, as it is simple. ""The object with a red border and a wavy pattern inside"" gives both of these and should be unique.

Finally, I remember the context. I'm supposed to avoid using absolute spatial positions. I must also assume that the listener can see all objects, and there are no hidden objects that I need to account for.

Given this analysis, I've narrowed it down. After thinking about the most complete and robust option and rechecking that each of these describes the target uniquely, I am selecting: ""The object with the red border and the wavy pattern inside."" as my final description to be provided to the listener. This is sufficiently clear and should prevent any confusion.

exp2_108.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,4,square,red,"wavy, zigzag","1,3",The square object with the wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object in a Grid**

Okay, here's the task: I need to describe a target object in a visual reference game so the other participant can select it. The image is a 3x3 grid, and I need to formulate a description.

First, I'm analyzing the image. It's a grid, and some cells are empty, some contain objects. I'm focusing on the position of the target object, which is the bottom-left.

Now, I'm identifying the target object's properties: It's a square, it has a red border, and inside the square, there are gray wavy lines. That's the core.

Next, I look at the distractors – the other objects in the grid: there are circles with different border colors (blue and red) and gray fill patterns (wavy lines, vertical stripes, and dots). Also, there are hidden objects behind red curtains marked with a question mark. The hidden objects add complexity. I want to describe the target object such that even if there are identical hidden objects, my description still differentiates the target from the visible objects.

Now, I need to craft a precise description. I can start by focusing on the unique shape. The target is a square, while the others are circles. This is a very strong and unambiguous starting point. I could just say ""the square object"". However, since there are hidden items, I should combine features to add safety.

I look for unique combinations. The square, with the wavy pattern, is specific. Even better, ""the red-bordered square"" also differentiates from the other red circles.

Now I compare combinations. ""The square with wavy lines."" Is there another square with a different pattern? Possibly. Is there another object with a wavy pattern? Yes, a circle. So this distinguishes it from the visible wavy circle.

I'm aiming for the simplest description that is still very precise. ""The square with the wavy pattern."" That's the clear winner. This combines the unique shape (square) with a visible pattern.

I consider different wordings for the final utterance. ""The square,"" ""the square with the wavy lines inside,"" and ""the object with wavy lines inside a square frame"". It's the simplest description combined with pattern that differentiates it the most.

To ensure clarity and avoid ambiguity, I decide on ""The square with the wavy lines""

I'm thinking:
- The target: Is a square, has a red border and a wavy pattern.
- Distractor 1: Is a circle, has a blue border, and a wavy pattern.
- Distractor 2: Is a circle, has a red border and a striped pattern.
- Distractor 3: Is a circle, has a red border and a dotted pattern.

Therefore, ""The square with the wavy lines"" is the final and best description. It ensures that the target item can be distinguished from any other.

There's a star and a triangle, both with grey dot fills. The star has a black outline, and the triangle has a red one. Since there could be other hidden objects, I need to be careful.

The obvious first approach is to directly identify the target. ""It's a red triangle"", or perhaps ""The triangle with the red outline."" But I can't be sure those descriptions are *unique* given the hidden content. The description *has* to be unique. ""The triangle filled with grey dots"" is tempting, but the star *also* has grey dots.

So, I need to contrast the visible features. The outline color, between red (target) and black (star), seems the clearest distinction. Shape is another: triangle versus star. The dot fill is shared, making it less useful for differentiation.

I keep coming back to combining features for maximum clarity. ""The triangle with the red outline"" is good. Concise but specific. It's safe since no other object is visible with those combined properties.

Could I use a different strategy? ""The object with a red outline"". It's simple, but I can't confirm that no other red object is hidden.

The safest play seems to be combining the features: shape (triangle) and outline (red). It eliminates potential ambiguity.

Ultimately, I want a concise description, but it needs to be *unambiguous*. Given the possibility of hidden objects, ""The triangle with the red outline"" is the most robust and elegant solution. I'm going with that.

exp2_110.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,2,"triangle, triangular",green,dot,"2,3",The triangle with the green outline.,"**My Thought Process: Deciding How to Describe the Target Object**

Okay, I'm in a reference game. My goal is to describe a specific object on a grid so the listener can pick it out. I need to be precise, especially because the listener might not be seeing the grid layout the same way I am.

First, I need to analyze what I'm looking at. I see a 3x3 grid with three visible objects: a dotted triangle with a black outline in the top-left, a dotted triangle with a green outline in the bottom-middle, and a wavy-filled circle with a blue outline in the bottom-right. The red box highlights the green-outlined triangle as the target. The rest of the grid is empty.

Now, let's think about the constraints. I'm the speaker, I need to describe the object *inside* the red box (which I see, but the listener does not). Spatial descriptions like ""bottom-middle"" are off-limits, because the listener's layout might be different. Also, there aren't any hidden objects to worry about.

So, I need to pinpoint the unique features of the target. It's a triangle, with a green outline, and a grey dotted fill. I have to look for unique characteristics to distinguish the target from the distractors.

Let's do a comparison. The black-outlined triangle shares the shape and the dotted fill, but the outline color is different (black vs. green). The blue-outlined circle is a different shape, fill, and outline color.

What's the best way to describe this? Is the shape (triangle) unique? No, there are two of them. Is the fill pattern (grey dots) unique? Nope. But the *outline color* is! Green is unique to the target object.

Therefore, the most direct approach is to describe the unique characteristic. I could say ""The object with the green outline."" or ""The green triangle."" or ""The triangle with the green outline."" I need to be specific enough to eliminate the distractors but as concise as possible. If I say ""The triangle"", it is ambiguous. If I say ""The green object"", that's good!

I'll check the constraints again: No location-based descriptions, no hidden objects, target inside a box I can see. All good.

So, the game plan is: identify target features, identify distractor features, find the unique feature that separates the target.

I think ""The triangle with the green outline"" is the best option because the green color immediately distinguishes the target from the black-outlined triangle and the circle. The shape also narrows the possibilities down to the two triangles, but the color definitively specifies which one. ""The object with the green outline"" would also work, as well as, ""The green triangle.""

**My final decision is:** I will say, ""The triangle with the green outline.""
"
exp2_111.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,"triangle, triangular",green,"wavy, zigzag","3,1",It's the triangle with the green border.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the goal is clear: I need to describe a specific object in this image so that someone else can identify it. It’s a reference game, and the target is highlighted by a dashed red box – that’s my cue. I see a 3x3 grid, but only some cells have objects. Since the layout and the listener's perspective are unknown, I can't rely on spatial terms like ""top right."" I have to use the object's inherent features: shape, border color/style, fill pattern, and fill color.

Let's break down the scene. I see five objects:

1.  A grey/white checkerboard square with a red solid border.
2.  A grey/white vertical stripes circle with a black solid border.
3.  *The target:* A grey/white wavy horizontal lines triangle with a green solid border.
4.  A grey/white wavy horizontal lines square with a black solid border.
5.  A grey/white wavy horizontal lines circle with a black solid border.

I need to nail the target, which, remember, is the triangle in the top right, with the green border. My brain immediately starts running through feature combinations to find the most unique and efficient description.

Shape: There's only one triangle. Score! That's a strong start. Border color: The green border is also unique. Fill pattern: Wavy horizontal lines is shared by the black-bordered square and circle. So that's not as discriminating on its own.

Now I'm combining options. ""The triangle"" works. ""The one with the green border"" works. ""The triangle with the green border"" is even better, really specific. ""The triangle with wavy fill"" would work, but it shares with the other objects. I'm focusing on the single, unambiguous features first to keep it lean.

I'm thinking about ambiguities. The prompt mentioned ""hidden objects behind a red curtain with a question mark"" but in this image, there are no curtains, only empty white cells. So I can assume the listener sees what I see.

Given the choices, ""the triangle"" and ""the green one"" would both work fine, but I like precision. I'm checking it. ""Is there any other triangle? No. Is there any other green-bordered object? No, the other ones have black borders. Is there any other object with a wavy fill pattern, within the group that is a triangle?"" No! Because there is only one triangle. So, I have several good options: ""Select the triangle"", ""Select the object with the green border"" or, ""Select the triangle with the wavy pattern"".

I'm going to lean towards combining a very salient visual feature: the triangle's shape and color, which feels instantly descriptive.

So, here's my plan: the description will be, ""It is a triangle with a green border."" That is clear, concise, and definitive.
"
exp2_112.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,"circle, circular",black,"wavy, zigzag","3,2",The object is a circle filled with wavy lines.,"**My Thought Process: Selecting the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object so someone else can pick it out from the grid. Let's break this down systematically.

First, I see the playing field: a 3x3 grid with a few filled cells, and the target object highlighted. Time to analyze. I've got to identify the target's visual properties. It's a circle, with a distinct black border, and a gray fill composed of wavy horizontal lines. It sits in the middle row, right column of the grid.

Now, let's look at the other objects, the distractors. I'm focusing on features that will distinguish them. I see a triangle (checkerboard fill), another circle (red border, polka dots), a square (black border, polka dots), and another triangle (black border, wavy fill, just like my target!)

The challenge is to create a description that uniquely identifies the target, and avoid ""degenerate"" descriptions (i.e. descriptions that give the object's spatial location). I need to combine features. ""It's a circle"" is a good start, but there's another circle. ""It has a wavy pattern"" is better, but another shape, the triangle has the wavy pattern! And ""it has a black border"" won't work, because more than one object has this border.

""The circle with the wavy pattern"" is promising. No other object is both a circle and wavy. Then I also thought about ""the circle with the black border"". Again, this is a distinguishing description. However, the first description is still stronger because the wavy pattern is a very salient visual feature.

To make it robust, I considered combining more features. I came up with a final description, *“the circle filled with wavy lines.""* This seems really clear. Now let's do a sanity check:

Target: Circle, black border, wavy fill.
Distractor 1: Triangle, black border, checkerboard fill.
Distractor 2: Circle, red border, polka dot fill.
Distractor 3: Square, black border, polka dot fill.
Distractor 4: Triangle, black border, wavy fill.

""The circle filled with wavy lines"" clearly fits the target. No other object matches that description, so the description should work. I'm feeling confident in this description.

exp2_113.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,"circle, circular",red,"wavy, zigzag","3,2",The object is a circle that has a wavy pattern inside.,"**My Analysis of the Reference Game**

Okay, so I'm being asked to act as the speaker in a reference game. My task is to describe a target object within a 3x3 grid that's partially visible. The other person can only see the same part of the grid that I can see, but a red dashed box highlights the target *for me* that they can't see.

First, I need to analyze what's visible. I see a red curtain with a question mark, then the target (a circle with a wavy grey and white pattern), and another curtain. In the bottom row, I see a triangle with a grey and white checkerboard pattern, and then another curtain. The goal is to formulate a description that helps the other person select the target.

Identifying the target is simple enough: it's that circle with the wavy pattern. Now, let's look at the distractors – the triangle with the checkerboard pattern and those hidden things behind the curtains. I have to create a description that differentiates the target from the visible *and* the potentially hidden objects. I need to be careful; I have to assume the other person knows nothing about the red dashed box and the target, and that anything behind the curtains could potentially be anything.

Shape and pattern are the obvious distinguishing features. The target is a circle, while the visible distractor is a triangle. The pattern is wavy lines versus a checkerboard. Color is there too, but I'm focusing on shape and pattern as more salient features. Considering the hidden elements, I need to be as specific as possible. Describing the target as ""the circle with the wavy pattern"" is likely to be the best approach. It combines shape and pattern, and it feels pretty unlikely that a hidden object would share *both* those characteristics. ""The circle with the wavy pattern"" is straightforward and uses the most salient properties of the target object. It's concise and should effectively differentiate the target from the triangle and whatever lies hidden. ""The shape is a circle and it has a wavy pattern inside"" is a nice alternative, as well.

The final description I'm choosing is: ""The object is a circle that has a wavy pattern inside."" It is concise, it is unambiguous, and it doesn't rely on relative location, which is important because the other person may see the objects from a different perspective.
"
exp2_114.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,square,red,"wavy, zigzag","1,2",The square with the red border that has a grey and white wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process for the Reference Game**

Okay, here's the situation: I need to describe a target object so someone else can pick it out from a group. The target, helpfully marked by a dashed red box (which I should ignore, of course!), appears to be a square. My primary goal is to provide a description that is unambiguous.

First, I need to break down the target object and compare it to the distractors. The target is a square with a red (or reddish-brown) border and a distinct interior pattern of alternating grey and white wavy stripes. This needs to be a distinctive description.

Now, I look at the distractors. Distractor 1 is a five-pointed star with a green outline and vertical grey and white stripes inside. Distractor 2 is another five-pointed star, but this one has a red (or reddish-brown) border and a checkerboard pattern of grey and white squares inside.

The key is identifying unique features. The most obvious is the shape: The target is a square; the others are stars. This immediately gives me a good starting point. The border color (""red"") isn't unique, because it's shared with the second distractor. The grey/white coloring is shared across the objects, so I should focus on the pattern instead. The target's wavy pattern is different from the striped and checkerboard patterns of the other objects. That's a strong differentiator.

With this in mind, I can start formulating potential descriptions. I want something concise but descriptive. ""It's the square"" would work, because there's only one. ""It's the object with the wavy pattern"" is also a decent, short option. I can combine these: ""It's the square with the wavy pattern inside."" Now I am confident that I have a solid description.

I'm thinking about adding the border color for extra clarity: ""The square with a red border and a grey and white wavy pattern inside"". This would be very robust. I need to avoid location-based descriptions (""the one in the middle left"") since the arrangement of these objects may change.

Ultimately, I want to land on the most efficient and clear description. Let's start with, ""It's the square with the wavy pattern inside."" This is good, concise, and relies on the unique shape and pattern. I can add the color detail for clarity: ""It's the square with a red border and a grey and white wavy pattern inside."" I think I will use a description like this. The shape is the strongest feature, so I'll start with that, and add the pattern for extra clarity.
"
exp2_115.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,"triangle, triangular",green,dot,"3,3",The object is a triangle filled with dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being asked to play the role of a speaker in a reference game. My objective is to help someone identify a specific object within a grid, given that I can't see the image. I have to create a description that is clear, concise, and unambiguous. Let's break this down systematically.

First, I need to understand the visual context. I'm imagining a 3x3 grid with different shapes and patterns. Some cells are empty, but the important ones contain objects that differ in shape, color, and internal pattern.

Next, the crucial step: Identifying the target. I'm told to focus on the bottom-right cell. This cell contains a green triangle filled with grey dots. I must be able to describe this accurately.

Now, for the key part: crafting a description. I need to avoid using any spatial terms like ""bottom-right,"" because I can't assume the listener has the same viewpoint. I want to make sure I don't give away any unneeded information that might confuse the listener.

I'm thinking, ""Is 'triangle' enough?"" No, there's another triangle in the grid. What about ""green object?"" Yes, there is only one green object. But is this the most informative description? No, because it doesn't describe the shape or pattern. Let me consider other options, ""object with dots?"" That fails, there's a red square with dots. How about ""the green triangle?"" Yes, this sounds unique, because there's a blue triangle. What about ""the triangle with dots?"" Yes, this also sounds unique, because the other triangle has stripes, and the other dotted object is a red square.

Therefore, my final description is going to be ""the triangle with dots"". This description is the most efficient. This is very good!

Alternatively I could say, ""The green triangle filled with dots"" or simply ""the green triangle"". Both are also very good.

exp2_116.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,star,black,stripe,"3,3",Select the star with the vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the speaker role in a reference game. My task is to guide my partner to select the correct object based on a visual grid. Let's break this down systematically.

First, I see a 3x3 grid with some empty spaces and some filled with objects. Crucially, there are two hidden objects behind curtains, indicated by question marks. My partner can see these hidden objects, but I can't. The target object is a star, clearly marked with a red box, so I know which object is the one to describe.

I begin by identifying the target object's properties: It's a star, with a thick black outline, and internally filled with alternating grey and white vertical stripes. I also note the other visible object: a triangle with a green border and a grey wavy pattern.

The hidden objects are the tricky part. Since I can't see them, I need to be careful not to make assumptions. I must craft a description that works regardless of what's behind those curtains.

So, I need to focus on what *I* can see. The best approach is to be as specific as possible about the visible features of the target object.

I started by formulating descriptions: first, the shape: ""It's a star."" Then, adding the pattern: ""It has vertical stripes inside."" Then I could add color: ""The stripes are grey and white."" I considered ""the star with the vertical stripes"" and ""The star with the black outline and vertical stripes inside.""

The key is to distinguish it from the other visible object (a triangle with a wavy pattern). The internal pattern is the most unique characteristic of the target object. It's the most reliable feature to use for disambiguation, even if there are other stars (or non-stars) hidden.

I compared the other options; ""the star with vertical stripes"" is a good description. The most distinguishing feature, besides the shape, is the pattern inside.

I checked for potential ambiguity. Could there be another star with vertical stripes? Possible, but unlikely. The most salient features are shape and pattern. The instruction should allow the user to pick the correct object even if another star exists behind a curtain. For example, if there's a solid red star behind a curtain, ""the star with vertical stripes"" works perfectly. If there's a star with *horizontal* stripes, ""the star with vertical stripes"" works perfectly.

So, ""the star with vertical stripes"" is a concise and complete description. This strategy is based on shape and the most salient property; the unique pattern.
"
exp2_117.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,star,black,"wavy, zigzag","3,3",Select the star that has a black outline and is filled with a wavy pattern.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to guide the listener to select a specific object within this grid using only a verbal description. The catch? I can only see some of the objects, not all.  I need to craft a description that uniquely identifies the *target* object, even if the listener has a broader view of the entire scene.

First, I assessed the visual data: I’m working with a 3x2 grid. Four cells are visible: two empty, and two with stars. Critically, there are two covered cells where the listener's perspective differs from my own. I can't directly *know* what they see but must assume some objects may be present in these hidden cells.

The target is a star in the bottom right, indicated by a dashed red box. It has a black outline and a wavy grey and white internal pattern. The visible distractor (bottom left) is also a star, but it has a green outline and grey and white vertical stripes.

My approach:
1.  **Unique Identification:** The core challenge is to identify the target uniquely, irrespective of any potential hidden objects. I need to rely on the *visible* features to eliminate *visible* distractors.

2.  **Feature Comparison:** I zeroed in on the salient differences. Black outline versus green outline. Wavy pattern versus vertical stripes. Color and pattern are my key features to utilize.

3.  **Description Drafting:** I started by crafting candidate descriptions like ""the star with the black outline,"" or ""the star with the wavy pattern.""  These are good, but I need to be *sure* this description will do the job. I considered combining both features.

4.  **Refinement and Simplification:** Conciseness is key. A simple description is ideal, so I streamlined the language. The outline color, being a direct visual contrast, seemed like a strong descriptor, as does the pattern type.

5.  **Listener's Perspective:** Crucially, I had to anticipate what the listener sees, too. This is the crux of the reference game. For any hidden object, I must assume there will be objects with these same features.

6.  **Safety and Ambiguity:** Combining the features ""black outline"" *and* ""wavy pattern"" is the most robust strategy to prevent ambiguity, and is the choice I will make. It guarantees the listener knows which star is the target, regardless of the contents of the hidden cells.

7. **My final utterance:** The most clear way to get this across is ""Select the star with the black outline and the wavy pattern"".

exp2_118.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,star,black,dot,"3,1",It's a star filled with dots.,"**My Analysis of the Target Object and How to Describe It**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with this reference game, and I need to describe a target object clearly enough for someone else to identify it from a set of distractors. The target is inside a dashed red box – let's focus on that.

First, I see a star shape located in the top-right corner of a 3x3 grid. It has a black outline, and the interior is filled with a pattern of grey dots on a white background.

Now, I'm taking a look at the other objects, the distractors. I have to make sure my description is going to uniquely identify the target. I see a square with a green outline, also filled with grey dots. Then there's a red triangle with a grey and white checkerboard pattern, and another star, but this one has a green outline and a grey wavy line pattern inside. The rest of the cells are empty.

I need to come up with a description that isolates the target. The basic shape, being a star, isn't enough as there's another. The color of the outline – black – is unique at first glance. The filling pattern of grey dots is also somewhat unique but I see it in the square, so this alone won't do either.

I'm thinking about combinations here. ""The star with the black outline"" sounds good and is quick. It distinguishes it from the green-outlined star and all the other shapes. ""The star filled with dots"" is also distinct from the other star (with the wavy pattern) and the triangle (checkerboard). Combining these features is an obvious path. “The black star with the dotted pattern” could be really specific and unambiguous.

Then, there's the location; it's in the top right. But the instructions discourage explicit spatial location, and there's a strong hint that the object arrangements might vary for the listener. Better to focus on the inherent visual characteristics. I'm avoiding relative location descriptions too, just to be safe.

My main choices seem to be ""the star with the black outline"" or ""the star filled with dots."" I'm also considering ""the black star with grey dots inside.""

Considering the other objects again – the green square with dots – I need to be more precise than just ""the object with dots."" It has to be the star. The other star needs the wavy pattern noted, too.

Ultimately, I want a robust description, something that combines features to eliminate ambiguity. I think ""the star that is filled with dots"" is the strongest choice here. It neatly separates it from the other objects in the grid. ""The star with the dotted pattern"" is also a solid option. Alternatively, I could say ""the star with the black outline."" Either of those would work well.

Refining my phrasing now... I can make it even clearer: ""Select the star that has dots inside,"" ""It's a star filled with a pattern of grey dots,"" or ""The star with the black outline and a dotted pattern inside.""

I want it concise, though.

Shape: Star. That’s a given.
Distinguishing from the other star: Fill pattern (dots vs. wavy lines) OR Outline color (black vs. green).
Distinguishing from other objects with dots: Shape (star vs. square).

So, the optimal description is ""the star with dots."" Simple, yet uniquely identifying. That’s my choice.

exp2_119.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,"triangle, triangular",red,dot,"1,2",Select the red triangle with grey polka dots inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with acting as the speaker in a reference game. My primary objective is clear: to describe a target object to a listener so they can identify it. I need to be precise and avoid any ambiguity. Let's break this down systematically.

First, I need to *analyze the image* thoroughly. It's a 3x3 grid, but only the bottom two rows have objects. There are five visible objects. The top row is empty. In the middle row, there's a triangle on the left and a square on the right. The bottom row presents a circle, a square, and another square, left to right. Now, my focus shifts to the *target object* which is inside the red dashed box (which I need to remember is only visible to *me*). It's a triangle. It sits in the middle row, on the left.

Now comes the crucial part: describing the *features* of the target. Shape: it's a triangle. A very distinctive feature, indeed! Outline color: its border is red. Fill pattern: it’s filled with gray dots on a white background, or ""polka dots"". The dashed red box is just an indicator for me; I can't describe it.

Next, I need to analyze those *distractor objects* so I can differentiate the target. The square in the middle row (right) has a blue outline with grey vertical stripes. The circle in the bottom row (left) has a black outline with grey wavy horizontal lines. The square in the bottom row (middle) has a black outline with grey dots. The last square in the bottom row (right) has a black outline and grey wavy horizontal lines, just like the circle.

Based on this analysis, I'll *formulate a description*. The most unique feature is the triangle shape; it’s the only triangle. The red outline is another strong clue – again, it’s unique. The fill pattern (polka dots) is shared with one of the squares, so ""the object with polka dots"" would be ambiguous. Therefore, combining features is key.

Now, let's *draft some descriptions*. ""Select the triangle"" is simple, and it might work since it is the only triangle. ""Select the object with the red outline"" is also simple and might work. ""Select the red triangle with grey polka dots inside"" is specific and eliminates ambiguity. ""The object is a triangle filled with polka dots"" is a good blend. ""It's the triangle"" is concise and effective.

I need to consider the *constraints*. I must avoid any spatial terms like ""on the left."" The objects might be arranged differently for the listener. And there's mention of ""hidden objects"" that I can't see, so I need to be as specific as possible to differentiate the object from any unseen potential matches.

Finally, let’s *finalize the description*. ""It's the triangle"" is concise, but the shape could also be a hidden object, so I need to make it more specific. ""It's the object with the red outline"" is good, but it might not be enough. The most descriptive and safest option is to combine unique or semi-unique features, to maximize the likelihood that the hidden objects do not match, should they be triangles or have red outlines. ""Select the red triangle with grey polka dots inside"" is very descriptive and avoids any ambiguity. However, making it sound more natural is better. So, the finalized description will be: ""Select the red triangle with grey dots inside."" It's specific and eliminates any possible ambiguity.

exp2_120.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,square,blue,stripe,"2,1",The object with vertical gray stripes and a blue border.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. The goal is to describe a specific object in this visual scene so that someone else can identify it. They can see everything, but I have this handy red dashed box pointing out the ""target.""

First, I broke down the image. It's a 3x3 grid with empty cells and a few objects. There's a checkerboard square with a green frame, a striped square with a blue frame, and two mystery objects behind red curtains with question marks (I can't use these as clues!).

The target, specifically, is the square with vertical grey and white stripes inside a blue frame.

The challenge is to describe *this* object in a way that’s unambiguous, but without relying on its location or that darn red box I can see! I've got to focus on what's visually unique about it, something that sets it apart from the checkerboard square and hopefully will distinguish it from whatever’s hiding behind those curtains.

I can't assume that the listener sees the objects in the *same* arrangement as I do. That means no ""top middle"" or ""second row."" Also, I am very aware of the possible hidden objects.

The checkerboard object is the other object in the visual array. It has a green frame, and a grey and white checkerboard pattern.

So, I need features that are *specific* and *observable*. ""Blue frame"" immediately separates the target from the checkerboard, which has a green frame. ""Vertical stripes"" immediately separates the target from the checkerboard, which has a checkerboard pattern.

I considered different levels of detail. ""The object has a blue frame"" is good, but is there *another* blue-framed object? I don't know, so it is a good starting point. ""The object has vertical stripes"" is also good, but is there another object with vertical stripes? Again, I don't know. That's why I need to combine both.

I started with ""The square with vertical stripes."" Then I considered a combination of its features, I arrived at ""The square with vertical gray and white stripes inside a blue frame."" That's good. But I considered other possibilities.

I checked to make sure I wasn't using any spatial clues or the red box. It's specific enough to single out the target from the checkerboard and minimizes ambiguity.

The ideal description is clear and concise. So, let’s go with ""The object with vertical gray stripes and a blue border."" That's simple, directly observable, and covers the core differentiating attributes.
