exp2_001.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,2,"triangle, triangular",black,stripe,"3,3",The triangle with vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Decoding the Reference Game**

Okay, so I need to be a helpful speaker in this reference game. The goal is to get the listener, who sees the same image but potentially with hidden elements, to select a specific object: a triangle with vertical stripes in a 3x3 grid. They can't see the exact layout, and there might be hidden objects. This is key.

First, I break down the visible elements. I've got two triangles (one with wavy lines, one with vertical stripes), and a star (also wavy lines). I have to avoid using location-based descriptors like ""bottom right"" because the listener's perspective is different.

My initial thought is, ""The triangle,"" but that's immediately too vague. There are *two* triangles. So, I need to add some descriptive features. Then, ""The triangle with stripes"" pops into my head. Better, but which stripes? It's the **vertical** stripes that matter.

Now I need to refine and make sure my description stands up against all the visible objects. Is ""The triangle with vertical stripes"" sufficient? The other objects are a star with wavy lines and a triangle with wavy lines. Yes, this description is perfect to single it out.

Then I get a little paranoid. Are there *hidden* objects? Is there any chance a hidden object could also have vertical stripes? I can't *see* it, but the listener can. I need to be as specific as possible. Can I add more detail? Not really. The combination of shape (triangle) and pattern (vertical stripes) is the most distinctive.

I start to brainstorm alternatives, just in case. ""The shape with straight lines inside,"" or even ""The triangle with straight lines inside,"" could work, since the others have wavy lines. I could also say, ""The vertically striped triangle,"" which is concise and correct. Or a more comparative description: ""There are two triangles. Select the one that is filled with vertical stripes, not the one with wavy lines."" That's long but very clear.

But ""The triangle with vertical stripes"" still feels best. It's concise and uses the most salient features. It uniquely identifies the target, and it feels as specific as it can be.

I'm confident I have covered the two core components shape and pattern to narrow it down, eliminating the star. The pattern of vertical stripes is important to further narrow it down from the other triangle.

The final utterance then, will be ""The triangle with vertical stripes."" I hope that works.

exp2_002.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,square,blue,checker,"3,2",The object is a square with a blue border that contains a grey and white checkerboard pattern.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game, and my goal is to describe a specific object so another person can pick it out. The target is highlighted, but I can't use spatial terms. I also need to be mindful of unseen objects behind the curtains; a good description needs to be unambiguous, even with hidden elements in the mix.

Let's break down the image. It's a grid with a few objects visible: a star, the target – which is a blue-bordered checkerboard square, and a wavy-lined square. The key is to find unique features. The checkerboard pattern itself is the most distinctive.  It's grey and white with a blue border.  The visible patterns are polka dots, wavy lines, and checkerboard.  The star has a black outline, not a blue border, and the wavy pattern is green-bordered.

I need to come up with a description that isolates the target.  A basic description like ""the checkerboard pattern"" is insufficient, since there may be a similar pattern hidden. A more elaborate description would be ""the one with the blue border,"" but that could potentially be ambiguous with a hidden object, so I need to go deeper.

My approach will be to construct a specific description: ""It is a square with a grey and white checkerboard pattern and a blue border."" That covers the crucial attributes and should be unambiguous. I have to be specific enough to eliminate the other visible objects, but also consider what might be hidden.

I've got the crucial components: pattern type (checkerboard), the colors (grey and white), and the border color (blue). These three features should be specific enough to uniquely identify the target object.

I've considered and rejected a few alternative wordings. I'm aiming for concise and accurate.  I decided on the following:

**""The object is a square with a blue border, and inside it is a grey and white checkerboard pattern.""**

This should be completely unambiguous. It covers pattern, color, and border. All the necessary ingredients for a successful reference game are covered.

exp2_003.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,4,"circle, circular",red,"wavy, zigzag","1,3",Select the circle with the grey wavy pattern inside.,"**My Analysis of the Reference Game**

Okay, so the user wants me to act as a speaker in this reference game. First, I need to break down what I'm seeing. It's a 3x3 grid, and some cells are empty, some have objects, and some are covered by red curtains with question marks. I have no idea what's behind those curtains, so those are out of the equation for now. The target object is highlighted, which is helpful.

My next step is to nail down exactly *what* the target is. It's in the bottom-left corner and it's a circle. Inside, I see a wavy grey and white pattern, and there's a reddish-brown border around it.

Now I need to identify the other visible objects – the distractors. I see a star with a blue outline and a grey-and-white checkerboard pattern, and another star with a black outline and a grey-and-white polka dot pattern. There are also the curtains, but I'm not including those in the reference since they are not visible.

Okay, time to construct a description. It *has* to be clear and unambiguous. So, the key is the circle shape. That's a strong distinguishing feature right off the bat, since the other patterned objects are stars. Then, I need to use the pattern to add detail. I could say ""the circle with the wavy pattern.""

I have to be careful not to accidentally describe something that *might* be behind one of those curtains – I can only refer to the visible things. I want to keep it concise, too. So, let's see...

I could go with the most salient feature, the shape: ""It's the circle..."" Then add more detail about the pattern: ""...with the grey and white wavy pattern inside."" Combining those, ""The object to select is the circle with the grey and white wavy pattern."" Or maybe ""Select the circle with the wavy lines.""

Another approach is to distinguish it from the distractors with patterned features. ""There are three objects with patterns inside. Two are stars, and one is a circle. Please select the circle.""

I think the most efficient and direct is probably ""The circle with the grey wavy pattern.""

Before I finalize, let's do a quick check: Does this description rely on location? No. Does it uniquely identify the target among what *I* can see? Yes. Is it concise? Yes. Okay, I think that's a good description.
"
exp2_004.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,square,blue,checker,"3,3",Select the square with the checkerboard pattern.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to guide someone to a specific object within an image, the target, that's highlighted for *me*. I'm the speaker, and I need to craft a precise description. The game's constraints are important: no degenerate spatial terms (like ""bottom right"") and consideration for hidden objects. Right now, it looks like there are no hidden objects, but I have to be careful.

First, I need to understand what's in the image. I see a 3x3 grid with four objects displayed:

*   A black triangle with gray dots in the top middle position.
*   A green star with gray dots in the bottom left position.
*   A blue star with gray vertical stripes in the bottom middle position.
*   And, the target: A blue-outlined square with a grey and white checkerboard pattern in the bottom right position.

Since I am an expert in this field, I will immediately begin comparing the objects. The target is, uniquely, a square, it has a blue outline, and its fill pattern is a checkerboard. That means it is the only object with any of these features.

The key is to come up with a description that's *unambiguous* and can be understood even if the grid layout changes, or if there were some occluded objects. Shape and pattern are the most reliable. Considering the other items, a few descriptions spring to mind:

*   ""The square"" (since it's the only one).
*   ""The object with the checkerboard pattern"" (again, it's the only one).
*   ""The blue square with a checkerboard pattern inside."" This is more descriptive.

I'll lean towards combining the most salient properties of the square. It's concise and descriptive: I can't think of anything better, so I'll go with this utterance.

Final Utterance: ""Select the square with the checkerboard pattern.""
"
exp2_005.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,square,blue,"wavy, zigzag","2,3",Select the square that is filled with a wavy pattern.,"**My Thought Process: Selecting the Target Object**

Okay, here's the situation. I need to describe a target object in a reference game so someone else can pick it out. The target has a dashed red box around it, so I know which one it is.

First, I analyze the target. It's a blue-outlined square with horizontal, wavy, alternating gray and white lines inside. Then, I look at the distractors: a blue-outlined triangle with a gray and white checkerboard pattern, a red-outlined square with the same checkerboard, and a blue-outlined star with vertical gray and white stripes.

My approach is this: identify a feature unique to the target. Shape (square) isn’t enough, since there’s another square. Outline color (blue) isn’t enough either, because there are two other blue-outlined objects. Ah! The wavy pattern is unique. No other object has that.

So, the simplest description is probably ""The object with the wavy pattern."" This should be clear, but I can add more details for extra clarity. If I combine shape, outline, and pattern, I get ""It's a square with a blue outline and a wavy pattern inside."" But, is this overkill? I need to be efficient.

I considered location-based instructions but that's risky. ""Select the square that has a wavy pattern inside"" is clear. I can add the color: ""Select the blue-outlined square that has a wavy pattern inside."" But is that too verbose? Is the target distinguishable? I need to be minimal. Let's think: The other square is red. So ""The blue-outlined square"" is sufficient? Yes! That's it!

Wait, is there only one blue-outlined square? Yep. That description is efficient and accurate. So, I will focus on the most visual and unique feature. I know! I can use ""The square with a wavy pattern."" The other square does not have that. This should work great. ""The object is a square and is filled with a wavy pattern."" is also a good phrasing.
"
exp2_006.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,"circle, circular",black,checker,"2,1",The object is a circle with a checkerboard pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the goal is to describe this target object so someone else can identify it. I'm essentially playing a reference game. First, I need to break down what I see. The target is highlighted – a good start! It’s in the top row, middle column, but I can't use spatial terms. I need to focus on its properties: it's a circle, black outline, and a grey and white checkerboard fill.

Now, I look at the distractors. The top-right is a triangle with a red outline and a checkerboard fill. Middle right is a square, blue outline, polka dot fill. Bottom left is a star, blue outline, and checkerboard fill. Bottom middle is a circle, red outline, and wavy line fill. The rest of the cells are empty.

My initial thought is to figure out what uniquely identifies the target. Shape, outline color, and fill are the key properties. ""The circle"" won't work alone because there's another. The black outline is unique. However, the checkerboard fill is shared.

Okay, let's explore descriptions. ""The object with the black outline"" is concise and unique. ""The circle with the checkerboard pattern"" is also unique, as it differentiates it from the other circle and other checkerboard objects. ""The circle with the black outline"" works too.

I need to decide the *best* description. ""The object with the black outline"" is efficient, but maybe not as descriptive. Combining both features is more robust. ""It's a circle with a black outline and a checkerboard pattern inside."" That's unambiguous.

I need to avoid spatial terms. The prompt explicitly says so. Also, it mentions hidden objects. I have to assume my description will be unique among all the objects, even those hidden. Specificity is key!

I need to refine the wording. ""Select the circle with a black outline and a checkerboard pattern."" works. ""The object is a circle filled with a checkerboard pattern"" is also accurate. The checkerboard is shared with other objects. The black outline is unique, but combining shape and pattern seems a clear strategy.

Let's test this: ""There is a circle with a checkerboard pattern."" Is there another circle? Yes, but it has a wavy pattern. Is there another checkerboard? Yes, on a triangle and star, but not on a circle. So, unique.

""There is an object with a black outline."" Is there any other? No. That's simpler, but less descriptive.

I think the combination of shape and pattern is the strongest. ""The object is a circle filled with a checkerboard pattern"" is clear. I'll go with that. It's the most unambiguous description given the context of the distractors.
"
exp2_007.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,"circle, circular",red,stripe,"1,3",The striped circle with a red outline.,"**My Thought Process on Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object clearly enough that someone else can identify it without any positional clues. I need to be precise, considering there could be other objects hidden from my view, and their arrangement might be different from mine.

I'm looking at a 3x3 grid. The top row is empty. The middle row has two red curtains with question marks and an empty space. Crucially, I *can't* know what's behind those curtains, but the listener *can*. The bottom row is what I have direct access to. It contains the target object on the left, an empty square, and then another object on the right.

The target object is in the bottom left, and it's a circle with a red outline, and gray and white vertical stripes within. The dashed red box is just highlighting the target for *me*; the listener sees a solid outline. The other visible object, on the right, is also a circle with vertical gray and white stripes, but it has a blue outline.

My primary task is to clearly differentiate the target from the blue-outlined object. ""The circle with the red outline"" seems straightforward, but I need to consider those hidden objects. The game setup implies that the hidden objects should be designed in such a way that the listener can be able to work the answer, but from my perspective I must keep in mind all possibilities. There might be *another* red-outlined circle behind one of those curtains!

Given the available information, the key distinguishing feature *among the visible objects* is the color of the outline. ""The circle with the red outline"" is concise, but potentially ambiguous if one of the hidden objects is also red.

The question of whether or not to include information about the internal pattern of vertical stripes arises. If I say ""The circle with the red outline,"" I need to consider that the red-outlined circle behind the curtain could be different (e.g., solid red). So, let me be more specific and say ""The striped circle with the red outline."" That's a more complete and unambiguous description based on *what I can see*. I'm thinking about describing both the ""red outline"" AND the ""stripes.""

Ultimately, my core strategy must be based on the principle of describing what is visible in a manner that will ensure clarity, even if there are multiple possibilities within the game itself. The best, most robust, strategy is therefore: ""The striped circle with a red outline."" It accurately describes the object based on its visible properties. It's concise and focuses on the most prominent visible differences compared to the other visible object.
"
exp2_008.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,"triangle, triangular",blue,stripe,"3,1",Select the object that is filled with vertical stripes.,"**Analyzing the Target and Distractors**

Okay, here's the situation: I'm acting as a speaker in this reference game. My goal is clear – describe the highlighted object so that someone else can pick it out. I need to be precise, avoiding spatial references because the layout might be different for the other person.

First, I need to understand what I'm looking at. The target is a triangle, with a blue outline and vertical grey stripes filling it. I've scanned the other objects too: a green-outlined square with wavy grey stripes, a red-outlined square with the same wavy stripes, a blue-outlined star with wavy grey stripes, and a green-outlined circle also with wavy grey stripes. There are also a few empty cells.

**Identifying Unique Features**

The key is to find what makes the target stand out. It's the only triangle, a very strong distinguishing feature. The outline color, blue, is shared with the star, so that alone isn’t enough. However, the vertical stripes are *unique*. All the other filled shapes have a wavy pattern.

**Formulating and Refining Descriptions**

I'm thinking, ""How can I describe this clearly and unambiguously?"" ""Select the triangle"" is simple, and it should work because there's only one. Similarly, ""Select the shape with vertical stripes"" is also good, since that detail is unique. I could combine features for even more clarity, maybe ""Select the blue triangle with vertical stripes,"" but that seems a little verbose.

**Avoiding Ambiguity and Choosing the Best Description**

The instructions mentioned something about ""red curtains with a question mark"", but that isn't present, so no need to worry about that. I need to avoid spatial descriptions, which I'm already doing. Considering everything, both the shape and the fill pattern would be fine on their own.

I could start with a more general description. ""There are two shapes with a blue outline"" (the triangle and the star), then ""Select the one that is a triangle."" or ""There are several shapes with a grey fill pattern"" (all the filled shapes), then ""Select the one with vertical stripes.""

But the most direct approach is better.

I'm thinking the best bet is focusing on the unique feature that makes it different. It's the only shape with vertical stripes, and that pattern is more visual than just saying ""triangle"".

Therefore, I'll go with ""The shape filled with vertical stripes.""
"
exp2_009.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,"circle, circular",red,"wavy, zigzag","1,1",It's the circle with a red border and a wavy pattern inside.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I need to describe a target object in a 3x2 grid to someone else so they can identify it. This is a reference game, and my goal is clear communication. Let's break this down systematically.

First, I need to analyze the grid. It's not a full 3x3; it's more like a 3x2 with an empty column. The target is in the top-left cell. My immediate job is to figure out the important features of this target.

The target object is a circle with a red border and grey, wavy lines inside. Simple enough. There's another visible circle in the bottom-right, but this one has a black border and a grid of grey dots inside. There are also two hidden objects behind red curtains marked with question marks, so I don't know anything about them.

My challenge is to create a description that uniquely identifies the target, differentiating it not only from the visible distractor but also from anything that *might* be behind those curtains.

Initially, I think about simple descriptions like ""the circle."" Too vague. ""The circle with the red border"" is better, but I need to make sure this distinguishes it from anything hidden. ""The circle with the wavy pattern"" is similarly better. Combining both of these features makes the description more robust.

I'm thinking: ""The circle with a red border and grey wavy lines inside"". That seems pretty solid. But, is it the most concise and effective?

I need to consider the hidden objects. If one of the hidden objects *also* has a red border or a wavy pattern, my description becomes ambiguous. So, it's safer to combine both features. I can't be too sure about what lies behind the curtains.

Now, let's refine. ""The circle with a red border and a wavy pattern inside"" or maybe even just ""The circle with a red border and wavy pattern"". These seem fairly concise. Let me check the objects again:

*   Target: Circle, red border, wavy pattern.
*   Distractor 1: Circle, black border, dot pattern.
*   Distractor 2 (hidden): Unknown.
*   Distractor 3 (hidden): Unknown.

The combination of the border color and the pattern should make this description uniquely identify the target object. It's extremely likely that this is the best way to make the description precise even when considering the hidden objects. So, it should be simple, direct, and unambiguous, given the knowns and unknowns.

Ultimately, ""It's the circle with a red border and a wavy pattern"" seems like the most effective way to go.
"
exp2_010.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,square,red,stripe,"3,2",Select the object with vertical grey stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My task is to describe an object, the ""target,"" in a way that the listener can identify it from a set of images, some of which are hidden from me but visible to the listener. My initial step is to analyze the visible image. I see a 3x3 grid, with some cells containing objects and others empty. The target is a square in the middle-right cell, distinguished by a dashed red box. It's crucial for me to identify what I *can* see and what distinguishes the target.

I've identified the target: a square with vertical grey stripes and a red border. I must now compare this with the other visible elements, which are a red circle with grey dots and two red curtains with white question marks. The empty white squares are also distractors to consider.

To formulate the description, I focus on the object's features. Shape? It's a square. Pattern? Vertical grey stripes. Border? Red. The important thing is to make sure the listener knows *which* object I'm referring to. I can't use terms that assume knowledge about the hidden objects. Since I don't know what's behind the curtain, I need to focus on what I *can* see and make sure the description is true only for the target and false for all other *known* objects.

I consider a few options: ""Select the square with vertical grey stripes,"" ""It's a square with a red border and grey vertical stripes inside,"" ""The object with vertical lines,"" and ""The square filled with grey stripes."" I'm looking for a clear and concise description that is unambiguous. The ""vertical stripes"" pattern is the key differentiator from the visible circle with dots. The red border, while present, is also on the dotted circle, so is not a good differentiator. The pattern (stripes vs dots) is the most unique feature.

I'm thinking, ""the square with vertical grey stripes"" is probably the best approach. It's a simple, robust description.

Now, I revisit that. Is there a simpler approach? Because the only other object is a circle, perhaps I can simplify it. The main visual difference is the pattern: vertical stripes versus dots.

So now I'm thinking, is ""the object with vertical stripes"" sufficient? It should be! This feels like a good one, it's efficient. This is the best description I can give based on the information I have. The game's premise is that a good description based on what the speaker sees should be sufficient. So, let's go with that. The question is, does this work if the objects may be arranged differently for the listener? Yes. Since I am describing the actual object, it should be enough.

To make sure that my description has a natural sound, I decide to modify the description slightly:

**My Final Answer:**

""Select the object with vertical stripes.""
"
exp2_011.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,square,black,"wavy, zigzag","1,3","It's the square with the wavy, squiggly lines inside.","**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to guide the listener to select the target object from a set of distractors. First things first, I need a solid understanding of what's in front of me.

I immediately start by analyzing the visual field. I see a 3x3 grid with a few objects scattered within it. There's a set of identical red curtains with question marks (distractors, clearly). Then, there's a square with vertical grey and white stripes, bordered in green (another distractor). And finally, there’s the target: a square with a wavy grey and white pattern, framed by a solid black border. That's the one I need to describe.

Next up, I zero in on the unique features of the target object. It's the wavy pattern that screams ""different"" to me, immediately setting it apart. That, along with the black border, seem like the key differentiators. The color of the pattern is also relevant. I need to formulate a description that leverages those unique visual characteristics.

Spatial location is out of the question; the listener could have a different view. That's a constraint I need to bear in mind. I think the wavy pattern is the most salient feature, easily distinguishable from the straight, vertical lines of the other patterned square. The curtains are a completely different visual category. ""The square with the wavy pattern"" is a good starting point. I'll test it for ambiguity and consider adding more details if needed.

I'm thinking, ""The square with the wavy grey and white lines,"" should be pretty unambiguous. Adding the black border is another good option to solidify the identification. ""Select the object that has horizontal wavy stripes"" is a more directive alternative. I don’t want to overload the description with unnecessary information. The objective is clarity and brevity.

My thought process is now about refining the description. I need to choose the most concise yet complete description. I'm going to eliminate any mention of the red curtains, since my target's description is already unique, so that would just add unnecessary noise.

After some quick checks, I come up with a couple of strong contenders, such as ""The square with the wavy grey and white pattern and a black border."" I need to confirm that this description unambiguously points to the target. Yes, the vertically striped square with the green border is clearly distinguishable, and the red curtains provide no competition.

Okay, let's keep it concise! Ultimately, I'm aiming for something straightforward and focusing on the object's unique, distinguishing features. ""The square with the wavy pattern"" should suffice, but to ensure that I'm unambiguous, I'll add the border color. ""It's the square with the wavy pattern and a black border."" I could add more information, but I don't want to over-complicate the instructions.

So, I think I'll go with a slightly more descriptive, yet direct phrase: ""It's the square containing a wavy grey and white pattern inside a black frame."" Yes, I believe that is the most helpful and unambiguous way to describe the target object.
"
exp2_012.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,"triangle, triangular",black,"wavy, zigzag","2,3",Select the triangle that has a wavy pattern inside.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, here's how I'm thinking through this reference game. The goal is to accurately describe the highlighted object – the target. It's important to provide enough information that the other person can identify it without ambiguity, regardless of the objects' arrangement.

First, I've got to break down what I see. The target is a triangle. It has a thick black outline, and the inside is filled with a grey and white horizontal wavy line pattern. Now, let's look at the surrounding objects within this 3x3 grid for context. I see: a red-outlined circle with grey dots, a green-outlined circle with grey dots, a red-outlined circle with vertical grey and white stripes, and a star with a thick black outline and a grey and white horizontal wavy line pattern.

Now comes the key: What makes the triangle unique? Well, it's the *only* triangle. That's a huge advantage! However, the star also has that wavy line pattern and the black outline. So, I need to make sure my description doesn't point to the star accidentally.

I could say, ""Select the triangle."" That's the most concise, but will it be enough? Perhaps not, given that some patterns are shared with other objects. So, I also want to make sure I add enough detail to distinguish it from the similar star.

The most straightforward strategy is to focus on that distinct shape. The wavy pattern is shared with another object, but the triangle is unique.

So, I've considered a few options: ""Select the triangle,"" ""Select the object shaped like a triangle,"" and ""Select the triangle with a wavy pattern inside."" The first is concise, the second is a little more verbose, and the last is more descriptive and includes the pattern. A more detailed version would be, ""Select the object with a black outline, a triangle shape, and a wavy pattern inside.""

I've decided the best approach is to combine the unique shape with the pattern as a confirmation. The other person can verify the pattern. This combines efficiency and clarity. So, I'll go with: ""The target is a triangle with a wavy pattern inside."" This feels solid. It's direct, uses the essential features to identify the target, and distinguishes it from the star. Perfect.

exp2_013.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,2,square,red,dot,"3,2",The square that's filled with grey dots.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm in a reference game. The goal is to describe a specific object within an array, and the listener needs to identify it. This calls for precision and clarity. Let's break this down systematically, thinking like an information scientist.

First, I need to analyze the scene. We have a 3x3 grid. I see three visible objects, and I'm treating the others as concealed. My target is the square with the dotted pattern. I can't use spatial location as an identifying feature.

Let's dissect the components. The target is a square with a dotted pattern inside and a red border. The distractors are a circle with a checkerboard and a red border, and a square with a checkerboard and a black border.

My primary task is differentiation. I need a description that *uniquely* identifies the target. ""The square"" is not enough because there's another square. ""The object with the red border"" is ambiguous because the circle also has a red border. The key distinguishing feature seems to be the pattern: the target has grey dots.

I'm considering multiple descriptions, evaluating each for ambiguity: ""The object with grey dots"", ""The square with grey dots inside"", and ""The square filled with many small grey circles"". All these descriptions are sufficient in differentiating the target.

I'm avoiding absolute statements since I'm told there could be other items behind curtains, even though I can't see them. This means I'll describe based on what I see.

Taking all factors into consideration, the most straightforward and effective description is ""The square that's filled with grey dots."" This description is simple, accurate, and uniquely differentiates the target from the distractors. I'm focusing on the *most salient* and *unique* feature of the target, and that's the pattern of grey dots.
"
exp2_014.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,star,red,checker,"3,2",The star filled with a checkerboard pattern.,"**My Thought Process: Describing a Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with acting as a speaker in a reference game. My primary objective is to describe an object within a visual array so that another person can select it accurately. This requires a careful analysis and formulation of the referring expression.

First, I need to understand the visual context, so I start by examining the image as a whole. I see a 3x3 grid with five visible objects: a circle, a square, two stars, and a triangle. I note the specific attributes of each object, including shape, border color, and fill pattern, as I'll need these later to differentiate them.

Next, I zero in on the *target* object, which is identified by the dashed red box. I recognize it as a five-pointed star with a red border and a grey and white checkerboard pattern filling its interior.

Now comes the crucial part: I have to differentiate the target object from the distractors. I identify the other objects to compare features. There's another star, but it has a black border and is filled with vertical stripes. There's also a square, which shares the checkerboard pattern but has a black border and, of course, a different shape. The circle has a wavy fill and the triangle, vertical stripes.

My approach is to find the *unique* combination of attributes. I considered ""the object with the checkerboard pattern,"" but that wouldn't work as there is a checkerboard square. I could use ""the red object,"" which is valid because no other object is red.

I realize I need to start with the shape (""star"") and then refine the description. Both the border color (red) and the pattern (checkerboard) uniquely identify the target star, so either could work in combination with the shape. I weigh different options: ""the star with the red border"" or ""the checkerboard star"". I could even combine the description, although that might be a bit verbose.

The challenge is to be precise but also as concise as possible, so I'm aiming for the best balance between clarity and brevity. So I choose ""The star filled with a checkerboard pattern."" This clearly describes both the shape and the internal pattern. I consider ""The star with the red outline."" as well, because the red color is very prominent.

Ultimately, I settle on the most succinct, yet still unambiguous: ""The star filled with a checkerboard pattern."" It's simple, immediately identifies the shape, and then utilizes the fill pattern, which is the key differentiator from the striped star. It's a precise enough descriptor to effectively allow another person to select the target object.

exp2_015.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,"triangle, triangular",green,dot,"3,2",Select the triangle that has a green outline and is filled with grey dots.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, here's how I'm thinking through this reference game. The user wants me to guide someone else to a specific object. My task is to provide enough distinguishing features to allow the other person to accurately select the correct item from a visual display. I have a lot of confidence that I can do this and quickly, too!

First, I see the **target**. It's inside a red dashed box, which immediately flags it for me. I've broken down its characteristics: it’s a **triangle**. The **outline is green**, and the **inside is white, filled with a pattern of grey dots arranged in horizontal rows.**

Now, I'm checking the distractors. I see **a blue triangle** below the target. Its **outline is blue**, and its **inside has a checkerboard pattern of grey and white squares.** This already gives me the beginnings of my differentiator. I also see that there are **two hidden objects behind red curtains with white question marks** in the top row. The user hasn’t described these, and I can't see them, but I assume the other person does.

So, I start to build my description from the most obvious characteristics. It’s a **triangle**. I’ll start there. My next thought is the outline. The other triangle is blue, so it makes sense to then describe the outline color: ""It has a **green outline**."" That is a solid differentiator. Then I consider the insides, so the pattern. ""The inside is filled with **grey dots**."" Bingo. That should be enough, right?

I’m running a quick check to see if I’m adhering to any constraints: I’m not using spatial locations like ""left"" or ""middle."" I'm also mindful that the other person can see the hidden objects too. So, I need to make sure my description is accurate and covers the obvious features.

Now, let's refine the description. I could try ""It's a triangle with a green outline,"" but if one of the hidden objects is a green triangle, I am going to have problems. Similarly, I could say ""It's a triangle filled with grey dots,"" but again, if a hidden object is similar, that isn't robust enough. ""It's the green triangle"" is simple, but ambiguous. Therefore, I’m leaning toward ""The **triangle with a green outline and filled with grey dots.**"" This is the most unambiguous description. It accounts for shape, outline color, and internal pattern.

Therefore, that’s my plan of attack. I'm going with the most complete and robust description. It's the most straightforward way to ensure accuracy, and I’m ready to proceed!

exp2_016.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,square,green,dot,"2,3","Of the two objects with a polka dot pattern, select the one that is a square.","**Analysis and Description of a Target Object in a Reference Game**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with this reference game, and I need to describe an object so someone else can pick it out. My mind immediately starts running through the logical steps. First, I have to *analyze the visual input*. It's a 3x3 grid, three visible objects. I break each down: a blue-bordered, wavy-patterned circle; a red-bordered, polka-dotted circle; and the *target* – a green-bordered, polka-dotted square.

Next, *identification is key*. The target is the square with the green border and the grey polka dots. Simple enough visually.

Then, I'm thinking about the *constraints*. I can't be spatially degenerate. No ""bottom middle"" stuff. I also have to consider *potential hidden objects*. There is mention of this ""red curtain"" scenario, so I have to be careful not to make assumptions. Most importantly, my description *must uniquely identify* the target.

Now, the *description formulation* starts. What's the best way to do this?
*   *Shape* is the most distinctive attribute: the target is a square, while the others are circles. ""The square"" should suffice... but what if there's another square hidden?
*   *Border color* is unique: green vs. blue and red. ""The one with the green border"" works, but same concern about hidden objects.
*   *Inner Pattern* is tricky. The polka dots are shared. So, saying ""the one with polka dots"" is ambiguous. ""The square with polka dots"" or ""The green object with dots"" is clear.

I start to *draft potential descriptions*, playing out different scenarios in my head. ""Select the square"" is concise, but risky. ""Select the object with the green border"" is similar. ""Select the square with the polka dot pattern inside"" is very specific. ""It's a square with a green outline, filled with grey dots"" is very detailed.

So now, I need to pick the best. The *optimal description*, I realize, hinges on *uniqueness*. The *shape* is the most obvious differentiator. The green border is also a good distinguishing factor. But I’m aware of potential hidden objects, so I want something robust. It's about efficiency and clarity here. The square with the green border... that seems like the safest bet.

My mind keeps returning to ""what if?"" What if there are multiple squares? Multiple green objects? So, it's back to specificity. ""The square with the green border"" is likely sufficient, but the ""grey polka dots"" is technically another unique property.

So I cycle through various forms... ""There is a square and two circles. The target is the square. It has a green border and is filled with polka dots.""... Too wordy.

I keep coming back to ""Select the square object with the green border"" and ""The object with the green border."" I focus on combining them for maximum clarity to guard against ambiguities.

I double-check. The blue circle has waves, and the red circle has dots.

Let’s ensure I satisfy the instructions: no degenerate spatial terms. My description must be robust in case of hidden objects.

I consider the patterns: Two have polka dots. The target is one. I should be careful how I phrase it. ""The square with dots"" or ""The green object with dots"" is sufficient. ""The green square"" is another good combination.

So I land on a strong candidate: ""The object that is a square and has a green border.""

A quick refinement: ""The square with the green border.""

A slightly more detailed option: ""The square with the green border and a polka dot pattern inside.""

I analyze the listener's perspective. They see three objects and potentially hidden ones. If I say ""The square..."", I'm in trouble if there's a hidden square. ""The green object..."" same issue. Combining at least two features - shape and color - seems best. The pattern is nice, but it's shared.

I settle on a final refined description: ""Select the square with the green border."" It combines two unique attributes.

I also consider a relational description using the shared polka dot pattern. ""There are two objects with a polka dot pattern. Select the one that is a square.""

I compare the two approaches: A) Direct: ""Select the square with the green border."" and B) Relational: ""There are two objects with a polka dot pattern. Select the one that's a square.""

Both work, but B might be slightly better because it helps the listener narrow down the choices. ""Okay, I'm looking at the two dotty things. Now, which one? The square one. Got it."""
exp2_017.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,4,star,green,stripe,"2,3",It's the green star with vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with acting as a speaker in a reference game. My primary objective is to craft a description of a target object within a grid so that another person can select it. I must choose my words carefully to minimize ambiguity.

First, I analyze the image. It's a 3x3 grid, but some cells are empty or merged. The top row hides one or more objects behind a red curtain with question marks. The top row also has one empty cell. The other cells contain the following: a blue-bordered circle with gray-and-white vertical stripes, an empty cell, a black-bordered square with gray dots, another empty cell, and a square with a black border filled with gray wavy lines. The target object sits in the bottom-middle cell. It is a green-outlined star filled with gray and white vertical stripes, encased in a red dashed border (which I won't mention because it's only visible to me).

Now, I zero in on the target. It's a green star with vertical stripes. I must formulate a description. Shape: it's a star, and that's unique amongst the visible objects. Color: the outline is green, also unique. Pattern: it shares the vertical stripe pattern with the circle.

I'm considering potential distractions. There are two squares, a circle, and hidden objects, and the curtain. The most immediate concern is what's behind the curtain. Could there be another star, a green one, perhaps even with vertical stripes? To be robust, I should use multiple features.

I begin drafting: ""It's a star."" This is a strong start. Now, let's add the color. ""It's a green star."" Is this enough? I consider. The ""green star"" seems ideal – simple, direct, and incorporates two unique features. Still, let's consider the hidden objects. What if there *is* another green star? I consider adding the stripe pattern, to achieve maximum clarity. ""The green star filled with vertical stripes."" However, I need to stay concise.

I'm checking: is ""It's the green object"" enough? Yes, the star is the only green object. The shape is unique – no other stars are visible. The color is unique. Combining features is the safest route, and ""The green star"" is short and clear. What about other potential descriptions? ""The green star with vertical stripes"" is even more specific, but perhaps too verbose.

I'm checking my wording against any constraints. The instructions mention to avoid “degenerate spatial locations”, therefore, “the object in the bottom-middle cell” is forbidden. Conciseness is key, and the description must uniquely identify the target. ""The green star"" is ideal, or ""the star with vertical stripes"" would also work.

What's the best balance? I decide to go with ""The green star."" It's concise and uses two unique features. If there were another green star, I could say, ""the green star with vertical stripes."" However, is that necessary?

I compare the target to other striped objects in the grid: ""Green star with vertical stripes"" versus ""Blue circle with vertical stripes."" The unique shape distinguishes it. ""The green star"" uniquely describes the target.

Therefore, my final decision: ""It's the green star."" It’s short, accurate, and utilizes two distinct features. I believe this robustly identifies the target. If the person has another green object, ""the green star"" is enough, as shape is unique. If the person has another star, ""the green star"" is enough, as color is unique.

exp2_018.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,star,blue,dot,"1,1",It's the star with the blue outline and a grey dotted pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the goal is to describe a specific object in an image so someone else can identify it, a classic reference game scenario. I'm seeing a 3x2 grid. The target, indicated by a red dashed box, is in the top-left cell. Let me break this down systematically.

First, I need to analyze the image. The target is a star, with a blue outline and a grey dotted fill. There's also a blue-bordered, grey and white wavy pattern square visible, plus two hidden objects behind red curtains marked with question marks. Those hidden ones are crucial; I can't accidentally describe them.

My strategy is to pinpoint the target object's distinctive features. I'm thinking of how to describe it uniquely. ""The star,"" is okay, but not specific. The blue border is also shared by another object, the square with the wavy pattern. So, ""the star with the blue outline"" is an improvement, but still not enough.

I need to nail down those unique differentiating characteristics. ""The star filled with grey dots"" is getting closer. Considering the hidden items, I think I have to combine these features to be as clear as possible.

I'm aiming for concise and unambiguous. ""The blue-outlined star that is filled with grey dots"" is precise. Considering the game context, I'm leaning toward, ""It's the star with the blue outline and a grey dotted pattern inside."" This avoids any potentially confusing spatial references, and keeps the language simple and direct. I'm satisfied that this description provides multiple identification points, making it highly unlikely to be mistaken for the wavy square or any of the hidden objects.
"
exp2_019.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,"triangle, triangular",red,dot,"2,1",The triangle filled with dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My goal is to describe a specific object in this grid so someone else can identify it. Here's how I'm approaching this:

First, I've got to analyze the scene. I see a 3x3 grid with four visible objects and five empty cells or hidden ones. My target, a triangle filled with grey dots and a red outline, is top-center. There's another triangle in the bottom-right, but this one has a blue outline and grey wavy lines inside. Crucially, I have two more objects hidden behind curtains. I don't know what *they* are, but the person I'm talking to *does*. This means I can't be lazy and just say ""the only triangle with dots."" I need to be precise enough to single out the target *even* if one of those hidden objects is also a dot-filled triangle.

My primary task is to find the right descriptor. The target is a triangle, with a red outline, filled with gray dots. The other visible triangle has a blue outline and wavy lines.

I need to compare them to construct a useful description. I could use ""the triangle with the red outline."" That's a reasonable start. Or, I could use ""the triangle filled with dots."" Given that both are triangles, and the outlines and fill patterns are the key differences, the fill pattern seems like the strongest differentiator.

I'm thinking that if the hidden objects are also triangles, they might have either a red outline or dots. So let's lean into the pattern difference. The dots or wavy lines are quite salient. So the description ""the triangle filled with dots"" is clear. It's concise. If the person has to guess which triangle to choose, this should be simple enough.

I could even be more specific: ""the red-outlined triangle with dots"". Maybe a bit verbose? I'm leaning toward the simplest description. Let's make sure it's unambiguous: ""the triangle with the red outline that is filled with dots"". It's pretty robust. But a bit wordy. ""The triangle filled with dots."" is more to the point. The dot pattern is the standout feature between the two. The color of the outline can be implicit.

So my final choice is ""The triangle with dots."" I can always refine this later. The key is to convey a clear, distinguishing feature. The visible distractor has wavy lines. Dots is the key distinction.
"
exp2_020.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,"triangle, triangular",black,dot,"1,1",Select the triangle that is filled with dots.,"**My Approach to the Reference Game**

Okay, so I'm presented with a 3x3 grid, and my task is to describe an object within it so someone else can identify it. The target is in the top-left cell, and I need to be precise.

First, I meticulously examine the target. It's a triangle with a bold black border, and inside, it's filled with a pattern of grey dots on a white background. I need to make sure my description captures that.

Next, I assess the other visible objects. There's a square with wavy lines, a striped triangle, and a couple of hidden objects behind question mark-emblazoned curtains. The hidden objects are a wild card, but I can only go on what is presented.

My primary concern is avoiding ambiguity. There's *another* triangle visible. So, simply saying ""the triangle"" is insufficient. I need a descriptor. The key differentiator is the pattern inside.

I start to formulate a description, testing different approaches. ""The triangle filled with dots"" is promising, because it's both accurate and concise. I consider ""the triangle with a polka dot pattern,"" but that might be overkill, given the relatively simple pattern.

I consider the unseen elements. Could there be another dotted triangle behind the curtains? Possibly. But I have to operate based on the information *I* have. If I use my current descriptor, and it's inaccurate due to a hidden object, the game's intent is no longer achievable.

The key is to give enough detail without making assumptions about what's hidden.

Ultimately, I decide to go with ""The triangle filled with dots."" It pinpoints the shape and pattern, making it a clear and distinctive descriptor and the best strategy to succeed in this game.
"
exp2_021.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,"triangle, triangular",red,stripe,"1,2",The object is a triangle with a red outline and vertical stripes inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the goal is clear: I need to describe the object in the red dashed box so that someone else can identify it, avoiding any positional references. I need to be precise, but also efficient. Let's break this down. First, I have to analyze the target object. It's a red-outlined triangle with vertical grey stripes. Next, I need to look at the other objects to find points of distinction. There's a blue-outlined circle with a checkerboard pattern, a green-outlined star with polka dots, and a red-outlined star with vertical grey stripes.

Now for the crucial step: formulating a description. I could say ""the red triangle,"" but is that enough? There is also the red star. ""The object with vertical grey stripes"" wouldn't work, because *both* the triangle and star share that. So the most important feature to focus on is the shape since it's the only truly *unique* attribute. ""The triangle"" would be unambiguous. But let's refine this to be extra sure.

The prompt mentions there's a ""red curtain with a question mark"" and I *don't* know what's behind them. So, I have to assume the set of objects is the same. Considering the red star, the only differentiating factor is the shape! Mentioning the shape is essential. ""It's the triangle"" works. I could add more descriptive features, of course, for extra clarity.

The most efficient and unambiguous description is ""the triangle"". But to be very safe, I can add a few features to the basic object name, such as ""The red triangle"". This differentiates it from the green star and blue circle, and the red star (by shape). I might say: ""It's the triangle with the red outline and vertical grey stripes""

Now, if I analyze these features in terms of their uniqueness to the set of objects, I see that shape (""triangle"") is the only unique descriptor. So mentioning the shape is necessary and sufficient. However, I want to be as clear as possible. The only reason ""the triangle"" might fail is if there's a hidden triangle in the setup! However, I have to operate on the information I have.

Here are the candidate descriptions: ""The object is a triangle,"" ""The object is a triangle with a red outline,"" ""The object is a triangle with vertical stripes,"" and finally ""The object is a triangle with a red outline and vertical stripes."" The key distractor is the red star with vertical stripes, so this needs to be distinguished somehow. So, the essential differentiator is the shape, ""triangle."" The full description combines unique shape and shared traits to provide confirmation to the listener.

The ""red star with vertical stripes"" is a key distractor. I must therefore distinguish the shapes.

Ultimately, I want to make sure the listener is certain, but also not verbose. So the best response is ""It's the triangle"". However, to be extra descriptive, I want to consider a combined approach, and say ""The object is a triangle with a red outline and vertical grey stripes inside"". This is a complete and unambiguous description. Let's choose ""It's the red triangle with vertical stripes"".
"
exp2_022.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,square,black,stripe,"3,1",The square with a black outline and vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Deciding on the Best Description**

Okay, I need to act as a reference game speaker. My task is to describe a target object (highlighted with a dashed red box) in a way that a listener can identify it from a different arrangement of objects. The key is to be unambiguous, even if the listener has a different set of visible objects. The dashed red box is just for *my* benefit, so I won't mention it.

First, I need to analyze the image. It's a 3x3 grid with a few objects visible. I identify the target: a square with a black outline and grey vertical stripes. There's only one square in the grid, but to be safe, I need to be more precise than just saying ""the square.""

I start by breaking down each object's properties: shape, outline color, and fill pattern. I compare the target object's features to the other objects to find differentiating characteristics. I immediately see that ""the square"" alone is unique because there are no other squares. But I need to be very robust to ensure it's still uniquely identifiable even with unseen objects, so I should be more precise.

I consider combining features: ""the square with vertical stripes"" works, as does ""the black-outlined object with vertical stripes"". The latter is less robust since the black outline can be shared by the target and another object, so that one is rejected. I also consider ""The square with a black outline and vertical stripes"".

I review the constraints. There is a point about ""hidden objects."" Even though there aren't any in *this* image, I need to act as if there *could* be. Therefore, the description must be specific enough to avoid ambiguity if there were other objects (e.g., hidden squares) that aren't currently visible to *me*.

So, my final plan is to create the most specific, unambiguous description possible, considering the other objects in the image. I want to describe the object based on its unique shape and the other features.

I compare options: ""The square,"" ""The square with vertical stripes,"" ""The square with a black outline and vertical stripes."" The last one, ""The square with a black outline and vertical stripes"" is most robust. I re-check to ensure uniqueness: yes, this combination of features describes only the target object, and does so in a way that is stable and complete.

Ultimately, I choose the description that provides the most detail without being overly verbose: **""The square with a black outline and vertical stripes.""** This is specific enough to identify the object uniquely.
"
exp2_023.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,"circle, circular",green,dot,"3,2",The circle with a green outline and grey dots inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing a Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with acting as a speaker in a reference game. My objective is clear: describe the highlighted target object (the ""listener"" needs to pick it out of a grid of other objects). My analysis begins by breaking down the image—a 3x3 grid with various shapes. The target is a circle with a green outline filled with grey dots. I must describe this clearly, avoiding ambiguity.

I'm thinking, my initial approach involves identifying and contrasting the key properties of the target with those of the other objects. The important things to separate it are the shape (circle), outline color (green), and fill pattern (grey dots). Now, to distinguish this circle from the others, I'll consider using a few different descriptions and assessing their effectiveness.

For example, I could say ""The object that is a circle with a green outline and filled with dots."" This is super specific, but is it too verbose? A shorter alternative: ""The green circle with dots inside."" Concise, efficient, but does it miss a critical attribute?

I'm starting to think through the listener's perspective. It's important to consider that the listener could have a different attentional focus. They might focus on color, shape, or fill first. This is where I begin crafting a few more options to make sure it's unambiguous for all potential listeners. One is, ""The shape with a green outline that is a circle."" Or, ""The dotted shape that is a circle with a green outline."" Good strategies, both of these.

Considering ambiguity, I'm noting that the listener might perceive the objects in a different configuration. Location-based descriptions like ""the one in the middle row"" are out. Now, let's explore some more specific and effective ways to go about describing the target.

I'm refining my ideas. The key is to be concise yet unambiguous. My thoughts are: ""The circle with a green outline."" That's simple, and it works. Another option is ""The green circle filled with dots,"" as there is another circle with a blue outline. I'm focusing now on efficient descriptions. ""The dotted shape that is a circle"" is effective because there is only one of these, but I wonder if my listeners will focus on the fill. What about ""The green shape that is a circle?"" This also works. Let's compare the options.

My thoughts are ""The green circle,"" or ""The dotted circle"" are ideal. I'm weighing the properties and it seems like the fill patterns (dots and checkered) are easier to compare than the color differences between green and blue. Okay, my focus is now on those two descriptions. Let's make it a little more verbose: ""The circle with a green outline that's filled with dots."" This will be a good fallback.

Here's the final evaluation: What's the easiest way to describe it to find it, given all the potential objects and the likely listener's attentional focus? It's all about minimizing the initial set of possible matches. ""Look for the circles"" creates a set of two options (circles). So does ""Look for the green shapes"" (two options). But ""Look for the dotted shapes"" is four. I'm choosing ""The green circle.""

I want to be sure it's the right choice. My final answer: ""It's the green circle with dots inside."" This should be clear and concise.
"
exp2_024.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,2,"triangle, triangular",green,stripe,"1,2",The triangle with vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Describing a Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game. My task is to describe an object in a 3x3 grid so the listener can identify it. The target is a triangle in the middle-left cell; it's got a green outline and grey vertical stripes. The challenge? No spatial cues allowed – no ""left,"" ""middle,"" or ""that one.""

My initial thought is to analyze the image thoroughly. I identify the shape, color, and pattern of all visible objects: the target triangle, a circle with a green outline and wavy pattern, and another triangle with a black outline and polka dots. My priority is to create a description that differentiates the target from the others.

First, I consider a simple description like ""the green triangle."" But immediately, I realize that's ambiguous because the circle also has a green outline. Hmm, so that won't work. The real focus should be on *uniquely identifying* it.

I then move to think about using the unique properties it has: shape, color, pattern. Let's see... ""The triangle with vertical stripes"" pops into my head. Perfect! The other triangle has polka dots. This description is concise, and it leverages the most distinct feature: the pattern. This description also takes the shape, triangle, into consideration. This alone will remove the circle from the choices.

I'm checking: What if ""stripes"" is unclear? Well, ""vertical"" is pretty standard, and the competing patterns are ""wavy"" and ""polka dots."" It's not likely to be misunderstood. What about adding color to the description? ""The green-outlined triangle with vertical stripes"" could be helpful. But, is it *necessary*?

I’m now evaluating whether this is sufficient. ""The triangle with vertical stripes."" Does this set of descriptions distinguish from all the other shapes? Yes. Is it using spatial language? No. It's safe to say that this description is robust.

I'm considering a variety of phrasings to make sure. ""The triangle filled with vertical lines?"" or ""The vertically striped triangle?"" all would work, and are very clear. However, I want a simple and direct sentence.

So let’s go with: ""The triangle with vertical stripes."" I now know this is a strong choice. It's concise, accurate, and highlights the crucial difference: the pattern. I've even considered whether color blindness might impact the effectiveness of a color-based descriptor. It seems better to highlight the differences in the pattern first. I think the key features - pattern and shape - are the most salient and provide a clear enough distinction to the other shapes.

I've considered other options, but ""The triangle with vertical stripes"" remains the best. It's simple, unambiguous, and effectively guides the listener to the target object.
"
exp2_025.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,star,blue,dot,"1,3",It's a star with a blue outline that is filled with grey dots.,"**My Thought Process for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game and need to guide someone to a specific object within an image. My internal monologue kicked off, and here's how I broke it down:

First, I had to take a good look at the visual field. I saw a 3x3 grid, a red curtain, some empty cells, and the objects in the bottom row. I identified the target – the star in the bottom-left corner, marked by the red box, which *I* need to disregard because the listener won't see it.

Next, I zeroed in on the star itself, noting the key features: it has a blue outline, it's a five-pointed star shape, and it's filled with a pattern of grey dots. I also identified the ""distractors"": the checkerboard square and those unknown objects behind the curtain (which make this more complicated).

My main focus was on generating a description that's both accurate and unambiguous, even with those hidden unknowns. Shape is key here. I started with ""a star"" and then described features that distinguished it from everything else, especially the checkerboard. I decided to mention both the ""blue outline"" (shared feature) and ""filled with grey dots"" (unique feature).

Then I drafted a few descriptions, starting simple and becoming more detailed: ""Select the star,"" then ""Select the blue-outlined star,"" and then ""Select the star that is filled with grey dots,"" finally arriving at the combination of both unique features. I also considered, but discarded, spatial references since they could be misleading if the listener had a different visual perspective.

I refined the descriptions, shooting for clarity and conciseness, like ""Select the star with the blue outline that is filled with grey dots.""

Finally, I did a mental check: Does this description make sense, considering the image limitations? Yes, It doesn't mention the red dashed box (good), it's specific enough to single out the star from the checkerboard (good), and it's robust, as it could be, against any unseen objects (good). If there were *another* star filled with grey dots hidden away, there's no way around an impossible task.

So, in the end, I decided on the following: *""The object is a star with a blue outline and it's filled with grey dots.""* This is clear, concise, and incorporates all the key elements needed to distinguish the target object.
"
exp2_026.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,star,black,checker,"1,1",Select the star with the checkerboard pattern inside of it.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game. My objective is to guide someone else to the correct object – the one inside the red dashed box – without relying on positional cues, since the grid arrangement might shift. The listener has a complete view of the grid, including behind the red curtains, but I, crucially, *don't*.

First, I need to break down the target: it's a five-pointed star with a thick black outline and a checkerboard pattern filling the interior. The checkerboard is made up of alternating grey and white squares.

Now, I look at the other visible items. There's another star in the mix. This one also has a thick black outline, but its interior has vertical grey and white stripes, not a checkerboard. There are also two intriguing red curtains, obscuring other items. I have no idea what's hiding behind them, so I need to make sure my description isn't accidentally referencing something out of sight.

The core of my approach is differentiation. My main goal is to identify how this target object is unique from the others *I can see*, so that it's easy for the listener to find it.

I've crafted a few descriptions. The first is: ""It's a star with a checkerboard pattern inside."" Concise, highlighting the key distinguishing feature. I then played with some others, such as ""Select the star that is filled with a grey and white checkerboard pattern,"" and a conversational alternative that explicitly contrasts the two visible stars. I like the clarity of ""The star with the checkerboard pattern,"" and I think I'll go with this one.

Before I commit, I'm doing a quick mental check. Does it rely on position? No. Is it accurate and distinctive? Absolutely. Does it separate my target from other *visible* items? Yes. Is it straightforward and easy to grasp? Definitely.

So, I'm confident. I'll go with a focused, pattern-driven description for clarity: ""Select the star with the checkerboard pattern inside.""
"
exp2_027.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,star,blue,checker,"1,3",Select the star with a blue outline and a checkerboard pattern inside.,"**Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in a reference game. My objective is crystal clear: describe the target object so that the listener, who is also playing the game and can see the grid, can identify it. They might see a different arrangement, or know what is behind the curtains, so I can't rely on spatial references like ""bottom left"". Let's break this down.

First, I need to analyze the image. It's a 3x3 grid, some cells empty, some with objects. The top row is empty. The middle row has a hidden object, an empty cell, and a triangle. The bottom row has the target, an empty cell, and *another* hidden object. Alright.

Now, let's identify what's visible and what's hidden:
*   **Visible:** The triangle – red border, grey dots.
*   **Target:** Bottom left. It's a five-pointed star. It has a blue outline, and the interior is a gray and white checkerboard pattern. The red dashed box around it is my cue, I think.
*   **Hidden:** I can't see the hidden objects; the other player can, so I have to assume they might be anything. I have a feeling the red curtains are going to complicate things. The listener is crucial here - this might make things more interesting.

My confidence is high. I am the speaker. The listener might have a different setup, some objects are hidden, and the listener knows what's hidden. The target is highlighted for me - 5/5.

Let's do a little mental simulation. ""Select the star."" Hmm, is that enough? What if one of the hidden objects is *also* a star? Like, a red star. That's a problem. I need to be *much* more specific. ""Select the star with a blue outline and a checkerboard pattern inside."" That's better. It's a very detailed description.

I need to consider the other visible object – the triangle with the red border and grey dots. My star description has no overlap with that; that's good.

Now, the hidden objects. This is the crucial part. I have to assume the worst. The listener sees them; I don't. What if there's *another* star? My detailed description, ""blue outline,"" ""checkerboard,"" should be enough. What if there's something *else* with a checkerboard pattern? My description ""the star with..."" will distinguish. And what if another item has a blue outline? My ""the star with..."" is the key.

So, ""the star with a blue outline and a checkerboard pattern inside"" feels robust. Specific, doesn't rely on location, and accounts for potential similarities with hidden objects by being detailed.

Here's the key: five-pointed star, blue outline, grey and white checkerboard fill.

Let's craft the perfect response. ""Select the star that has a blue outline and is filled with a checkerboard pattern."" Descriptive, specific, no spatial language. Assuming the listener will uniquely identify the target even if there are hidden objects.

Let's reread the prompt again. It's *conversational*! ""Imagine you are talking to someone..."" So, let's make it direct, but friendly.
""It's a star with a blue outline and a gray and white checkerboard pattern on the inside."" That works.
""Please select the star with the blue border and the checkered fill."" Also good.
""The object you should select is a star. It has a blue outline, and the inside has a checkerboard pattern."" A bit long but very clear.

I will be concise, clear, and direct. So, my final answer: ""Select the star with a blue outline and a checkerboard pattern inside."" That should do the trick!

exp2_028.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,"triangle, triangular",blue,dot,"1,1",The triangle with the blue outline.,"**My Thought Process for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game, and my goal is to make sure another person can pick out the right object. First, I need to understand what's in front of me. I've got a highlighted triangle—that's the target—a blue outline, and it's filled with grey dots. Then there are distractors: a black-outlined square with grey dots, a green-outlined triangle with grey dots, and a black-outlined star, also with the grey dot fill.

I need to come up with a description that's *unambiguous*. The grey dot fill is common to *all* the objects, so while it's a correct attribute, it won't help me distinguish the target. The user also reminded me to not use degenerate spatial locations as the objects might be arranged differently for the other person. They also mentioned that I should imagine that other objects might be hidden behind red curtains; I should keep this rule in mind.

So, the key is the shape and the outline color. The target is a triangle, but there's *another* triangle. The color of the outline is unique to the target, though: blue. So, the description should center on *that*. Saying ""the blue triangle"" or ""the triangle with the blue outline"" is perfect. It uniquely identifies the target, and it's concise. But, for extra clarity, I can include the common feature: the dot pattern. ""The blue triangle filled with grey dots,"" or ""The triangle with the blue outline that's filled with grey dots"" would be super clear.

The user also mentioned the objects might be hidden or displayed differently, so I need to make sure the description doesn't rely on where the objects are, but on what they are.

Let's check for issues. Is ""triangle"" enough? No. Is ""blue"" enough? Yes. Is ""filled with grey dots"" useful? No, all the objects have that feature. So, ""blue"" is the distinguishing feature. Combining this with the shape, the most effective way to communicate the object is with the unique attribute first, shape second. I could say, ""The blue triangle"" or ""The triangle with a blue outline"".

Therefore, I am going to say: **""The triangle with the blue outline.""**
It's precise, rules out all the other objects, and doesn't rely on location or any shared features. It is clear, concise, and effectively distinguishes the target. Adding ""filled with grey dots"" is not necessary for the target description in this context.
"
exp2_029.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,"circle, circular",red,"wavy, zigzag","1,3",The object is a circle with a red outline and a wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the user wants me to be a helpful guide in this reference game. My task is clear: describe the object highlighted by that dashed red box so another person can pick it out. Let's break this down systematically.

First, I need to *analyze* the target. It's a circle. Red outline. Grey and white wavy lines – kind of chevron-like but more sinusoidal – filling the shape.

Next, I need to look at the *other* objects, the distractors. I see a star with the *same* wavy line pattern and red outline! There's also a green-outlined triangle with a checkerboard pattern, a blue-outlined triangle with grey dots, and a black-outlined star with a different checkerboard pattern.

Now, let's identify what's *unique* about the target. Shape: it's the *only* circle. Outline color: red, but shared. Fill pattern: the wavy lines, also shared.

My first strategy is to capitalize on that unique feature. ""It's the only circle."" Simple, efficient, and direct. However, I should consider the fact that there might be other things outside of the user's view.

Strategy two is more descriptive. ""The object is a red circle,"" adding the color. Or, ""The object is a circle with a wavy line pattern inside."" Even better, ""The object is a red circle with a grey and white wavy line pattern,"" makes it more complete, but is it *too* wordy?

Strategy three involves comparison. I could say ""There's a red star and a red circle. I'm referring to the circle,"" but that's a bit clunky. Or I could say ""There are two objects with a wavy line pattern inside. One is a star, and the other is a circle. I'm referring to the circle.""

I think strategy one is the most efficient. ""The object is a circle"" is unambiguous. But is it *robust*? Is there another circle that I can't see?

Let's check my constraints. I'm a speaker, I'm helping the user, the layout might be different for the other person, but I can't refer to spatial locations, and some things might be hidden (though not in this case). My confidence? 5/5.

So, the simplest description relies on that unique feature, the circle shape. Let me consider the visual properties of the target again: Shape: Unique circle. Outline Color: Red, shared. Fill Pattern: Shared wavy lines.

I will focus on the unique shape, but add redundancy and clarity. I will give a description. ""The object is a circle,"" then ""the object is a circle with a red outline and a wavy fill pattern""

""Select the circle."" Is that good enough? It's short, but does it rely too much on something not being there? I should make it more robust.

I want to avoid being overly verbose. So let me try something in the middle.

""It's the circle with the wavy pattern."" Or ""It's the red circle."" However, there's a red star too. I need to take the other features into account.
So, I will focus on the unique feature, but I will then add the others.

""The object is a circle with a red outline and a wavy fill pattern."" That seems robust enough.
I can then make it more conversational ""The object you're looking for is the circle. It has a red outline and a wavy gray and white pattern inside."" This is too long.
I think I need to be more concise.

""It's the circle with a red outline and wavy pattern.""
Or
""There is only one circle, it has a red outline and wavy pattern inside."" This is a bit better.

Ultimately, I will begin with the shape and then add the other features for increased clarity.
""The object is a circle with a red outline and a wavy pattern inside."" That is complete and robust. 
"
exp2_030.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,"circle, circular",green,"wavy, zigzag","3,2",The green circle with the wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My goal is to describe a target object so someone else can pick it out from a set of distractors. The target is highlighted, so let's start by analyzing it. It's a circle with a green outline and a grey and white wavy pattern inside. I'll need to figure out what makes it *uniquely* identifiable.

First, I looked at the distractors. There's a green-outlined triangle with grey dots, a blue-outlined triangle with a checkerboard pattern, and a blue-outlined circle with a checkerboard pattern. There are also empty slots, but I'm assuming, based on the prompt, that those empty slots are not relevant to the problem.

Now, let's think about how to describe the target. ""The circle"" isn't enough; there's another circle. ""The green circle"" works, as there's only one with a green outline. ""The circle with the wavy pattern"" is also unique. However, just ""the green circle"" is shorter and still works.

Let's combine these features. ""The green circle with the wavy pattern."" This is accurate, unambiguous, and covers multiple key features. It's concise, so I'll lean toward it.

If I say ""the green one,"" it could be confused with the green triangle. If I just say ""the circle,"" it could be confused with the blue one. However, if I say ""the wavy pattern"" or ""the green circle"", it's unique. Since there's only one green circle and only one with a wavy pattern, each could be the correct answer.

The most distinguishing feature seems to be the pattern. The wavy pattern is the only one in the set, making it a strong differentiator. The outline's color is shared with the triangle and the shape is shared with another object.

Therefore, the best option is to combine shape, color, and pattern. I can say, ""The green circle with the wavy pattern."" This is a perfect balance of description and conciseness, using shape, color of the outline, and the internal pattern. It's precise. I'll check to see if my description uses locations or requires hidden information, and confirm that is not the case.

**Final Answer: ""The green circle with the wavy pattern.""**
"
exp2_031.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,"circle, circular",green,checker,"2,1",The object is a circle with a green outline and a grey and white checkerboard pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process in Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to guide someone to the correct object. Let's break this down systematically. First, I need to pinpoint the target. It's inside a red dashed box, a circle with a green outline, and a grey and white checkerboard inside. Got it.

Next, I need to analyze the context. There's a triangle with a green outline and a grey and white wavy pattern. And there are some mystery objects hidden behind a curtain – I can't see them, but the other player can, so I need to be *really* clear.

Now, how do I describe this? Shape is the most immediately obvious differentiator: it's a circle, distinct from the triangle. The outlines are green on both, so that's shared, not distinguishing on its own. The internal patterns – checkerboard versus wavy – are *key*. Colors are a shared feature (grey, white, green), so less useful for now.

I need a clear utterance. ""Select the circle with a checkerboard pattern."" is simple, effective and contrasts directly with the triangle. I'm considering all options though and I need to be more precise, so let's try something different. ""The object is a circle with a green outline. Inside the circle is a grey and white checkerboard pattern."" That covers everything. Alternatively, ""It's the circle with squares inside, not the triangle with waves."" That uses contrast, which can be helpful.

But, the curtain! I don't know what's hidden. That means I need to be *sure* my description is robust. Describing both the shape and the internal pattern is crucial. So ""The circle with a checkerboard pattern"" is really solid. I'm highly confident that there isn't something else that would match that.

Considering everything, I think my final utterance should be: ""The object is a circle with a green outline and a grey and white checkerboard pattern inside."" This is unambiguous and covers all the features. I could trim it down to ""The circle with the checkerboard pattern,"" but the longer version gives a slightly more robust description, and a specific statement will do. The other visible object is a triangle with a wavy pattern, so this should be sufficient. I am ready!

exp2_032.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,4,"triangle, triangular",red,stripe,"3,3","The object is a triangle with a red outline, and it's filled with vertical grey and white stripes.","**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game and need to describe this target object so someone else can pick it out. First, I identify the target: it's a triangle. Now, let's break down its features. It's a triangle, outlined in red, and filled with vertical grey and white stripes. I'm taking the perspective of an expert here, so I'm thinking about how to convey this clearly and efficiently.

I need to quickly analyze the other visible items: a blue-outlined star with a wavy pattern, a blue-outlined circle with a checkered pattern, and a green-outlined circle with vertical stripes. I also have to consider the unknowns: the two hidden squares behind the red curtains. These could throw a wrench in my description, so I need to be careful.

""The red triangle"" seems like a good starting point, it's concise. But, let me pause. Is there anything else red? No. Any other triangles? Also, no. So, ""the red triangle"" is a strong initial candidate. However, just ""the object with vertical stripes"" isn't enough, since there are two such objects (one triangle and one circle).

Combining features is key. ""The red triangle with vertical stripes"" is very accurate. To be really clear, I'll need to distinguish it from the circle with stripes. I can do this by focusing on shape (""the *triangle* with vertical stripes"") or color (""the *red* object with vertical stripes"").

Now I need to think about those hidden objects. Could there be another triangle, or another red object, or another object with stripes? Absolutely. So, a single feature might fail. Let's make this description robust. ""The red triangle"" seems very promising, and ""the triangle with vertical stripes"" also holds up well. I like the idea of multiple unique features to eliminate confusion.

The best description I can give would be: ""Select the triangle with a red outline and vertical stripes inside."" Or even, more conversationally, ""It's a triangle with a red border. Inside, it's filled with vertical grey stripes.""

I have to make sure my description is accurate. The target is, after all, a triangle, a red outline and vertical stripes. Given the other visible items, the combination of shape and outline color seems most efficient and unique: ""The triangle with the red outline and vertical stripes"". Or ""The red triangle with vertical stripes."" Both are effective and relatively short. This is going to work.

If someone were to ask me, ""The triangle with the red outline and vertical stripes."" works well, it is a noun phrase, which is a common way to refer to things. The key here, to make the shape crucial is the vertical stripes, but I still have to specify whether it is a *triangle* or a *circle* with vertical stripes. ""The *triangle* with vertical stripes"" is a perfect distinction. I can just stick with it. I'm going to add that the object is in red for clarity. I can always combine them for maximum clarity. ""The red triangle filled with vertical stripes."" But it may be a little wordy.

I need to consider the most salient unique feature. It's the only triangle and it's also the only red object.

I need to focus on shape. ""Select the triangle with vertical stripes"" seems like a strong choice because this is the only triangle on the board. This seems like a solid, quick choice.
"
exp2_033.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,star,green,stripe,"3,3",Select the star that is filled with vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being asked to play this reference game. My task is to describe an object on a grid so someone else can identify it. The key is to be precise and avoid any spatial descriptions that might change depending on the other player's viewpoint or any hidden objects. Let's break this down.

First, I need to *thoroughly analyze* the image. It's a 3x3 grid, and I can see four objects on it. I’ve gone through and systematically reviewed the objects, noting their position within the grid and their features: shape, outline color, and fill pattern. I've re-evaluated the grid. I have to remember that what I see isn’t necessarily what the *other* person sees, because of any potential hidden objects. The instructions mention a red curtain with a question mark, but I don't see one. So, I have to assume some cells might be hiding objects, which is why I can't rely on position.

The goal now is to *identify the target object*. It has a red box around it, so it's the one I need to describe. It's a five-pointed star with a green outline and filled with grey and white vertical stripes.

Next, I need to look at the other objects to make sure my description will work. I'll need to figure out how to differentiate the star from the others, the **distractors**. I need to think about the salient properties of each object: the circle, the square, and the triangle. The goal is to come up with a description that's *unique* to the star.

I need to come up with a description that will unambiguously identify the star. I can't say ""the one on the bottom right"" because of the instructions that say ""The objects might be arranged differently for the other person, so please do not use degenerate spatial locations."" I need to consider combining different features. The shape is unique – it’s a star. Only one object is a star. The green outline, the vertical stripes, and the checkerboard and dot patterns need to be considered. The color is not enough, because there are two green objects (the circle and the star). I have to describe the object that has vertical stripes.

Let's *formulate the best description*. I need to focus on what’s *most* defining. The shape (star) is unique, and so is the stripe pattern (vertical). The simplest thing to say is, ""Select the star."" However, that might not be sufficient if hidden objects exist. ""Select the object with vertical stripes"" is also pretty specific. The best description would be ""the star with vertical stripes"". The color of the object could also be included, since there are two green objects. However, ""The green star"" is not as descriptive as ""the star with vertical stripes."" The safest is to combine the shape and the fill: ""the star with vertical stripes"". This doesn't rely on spatial location.

Now I have to *craft the message* itself. I've considered several options: ""It's the star."" ""It's the object filled with vertical stripes."" ""It's the green star."" ""It's the star that is filled with vertical stripes."" The last option seems the most robust, so I'll go with that, or a slight variation.

Let's make it sound natural and concise: ""Select the star that is filled with vertical stripes."" It's clear, unambiguous, and relies on the object’s intrinsic properties. This description has two unique properties, so it has to work.
"
exp2_034.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,square,red,dot,"1,3",Select the square filled with grey dots that does not have a thick black border.,"**Okay, here's my thought process:**

I need to act as a speaker in this reference game. My primary objective is to describe the target object so the other person can identify it correctly.

First, I analyzed the 3x3 grid. I observed that some cells are empty, some have objects, and some are hidden behind question mark curtains. This means I need to focus on what I *can* see.

Next, I listed the objects visible to me. I see a square with a black border filled with dots, a circle with a black border filled with dots, an empty cell, a red dashed line highlighting the target, a circle with a green border and vertical stripes, and two hidden cells.

Now, let's analyze the target object specifically. It's a square. It's filled with grey dots. Its highlight has a red, dashed border, but that's a UI element for *me*. The listener will likely see a square, but what type of border does it have? I need to describe it based on the features the other person can see.

I need to compare the target to other objects to find differentiating features. It seems that the square in the top-left corner is similar to the target: a square, filled with dots, except that the top-left square has a thick black border. The target does not *appear* to have a similar border, or maybe it has a thin red border. The circles are obviously different shapes. The other circle has stripes, which is also helpful.

The key to a good description is uniqueness and clarity. I considered: ""The square filled with grey dots,"" but that is ambiguous because there are two squares with dots. I could say ""the square filled with grey dots that doesn't have a thick black border."" That is clearer and more specific.

I need to avoid the red, dashed highlighting border because it's not something the listener sees. I also need to avoid using position.

So, I formulated an instruction: ""Select the square filled with grey dots that does not have a thick black border."" This description focuses on features the listener *can* see and provides a clear distinction between the two similar objects. I don't think there is any possible confusion, as the only difference between the two objects is the border. I could also say ""Pick the square filled with dots that doesn't have the black outline."" This is good, also.

Therefore, the final instruction is: ""Select the square filled with grey dots that does not have a thick black border.""
"
exp2_035.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,star,black,dot,"3,2",Select the star with the black outline.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm presented with an image and need to provide a clear description to identify the target. This is a classic reference game scenario, and my goal is unambiguous identification. Let's break this down.

First, I need to analyze the visual data. It's a 3x3 grid, but only the top 3x2 section is visible. I see three distinct objects: a red curtain with question marks, a green star with grey dots, and a black star also with grey dots. The target is one of these visible objects, specifically the black star.

The most critical challenge is the similarity between the green and black stars. These are the primary distractors, so my description must differentiate them precisely. The curtain, while present, is less of a concern since it's quite distinct. Crucially, I have to remember the listener can see the whole image. They see what I see.

My process here involves: first, pinpointing the target; second, recognizing the key distractor(s); then, determining the salient distinguishing feature.

I'm zeroing in on color. Both stars share the same shape and internal pattern of gray dots. Therefore, the most immediately salient difference is the outline color: the target has a black outline, the distractor has a green outline. This is where my focus will be.

I'm initially considering a few descriptive phrases. ""The star with the black outline"" is simple, direct, and eliminates ambiguity. ""The black star"" is also great, but might not be quite specific enough. I'm also thinking of a conversational approach, ""There are two stars, both with dots inside. Select the one that is black.""

Ultimately, I want to use the most concise and descriptive phrase possible, considering the potential of additional objects beyond the curtain, which I cannot see. So, I will focus on properties the listener can directly observe. ""The star with the black outline"" seems the best choice, but I'll add ""with grey dots inside"" to enhance accuracy, despite the ""grey dots inside"" being present in both stars.

In summary, my final thought is: ""Select the star that has a black outline and is filled with grey dots."" or, even better ""The star with the black outline."" This description is highly specific, relies on observable features, and minimizes the possibility of misunderstanding.
"
exp2_036.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,star,green,dot,"2,1",Select the star with dots inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing a Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with acting as a speaker in a reference game. My objective is clear: describe the object within the dashed red box in such a way that another person can identify it correctly from a group of distractors. I need to be precise and avoid ambiguity.

First, I need to analyze the target object. It's a star. Okay, simple enough. The outline is green, and the inside is filled with grey polka dots on a white background. I need to keep in mind I should not use the positional data.

Next, I'll examine the other objects to find differentiating characteristics. We have a black-outlined circle with a checkerboard pattern, a blue-outlined star with vertical stripes, a red-outlined triangle with a checkerboard pattern, and a green-outlined triangle also with a checkerboard. There are also empty cells, and there might be hidden objects, but I'll focus on what's visible for now.

Now, it's time to formulate a description. Shape alone (""the star"") won't cut it, as there's another star. I need to find something unique. What can I use? Color, pattern, or a combination?

""The green star"" is potentially ambiguous because there's also a green triangle. But ""the green star"" by itself is unique. ""The star with polka dots inside"" is another valid and unique descriptor. I could also say, ""The star with the green outline and dots inside.""

I should refine the description for clarity and conciseness. ""The green star"" and ""The polka-dotted star"" are both short and sufficient, but ""The star with the green outline and dots inside"" is more precise, although longer.

Okay, let's select the best one. I think the unique pattern is my best bet. The dotted pattern is the most unique. The green color is shared with the triangle, so ""the star with dots inside"" seems more robust as it uses a completely unique feature. But let's check for ambiguity. ""The green object"" is ambiguous. ""The star"" is also ambiguous. ""The polka-dotted object"" is not. ""The green star"" is also unambiguous, given what's present.

I'll check the objects again: The target is a green star with dots, and the distractors are a blue star with stripes, a green triangle with a checkerboard pattern, a red triangle with a checkerboard, and a black circle with a checkerboard.

Now I am re-evaluating:
*   ""The dotted shape"" -> Unique.
*   ""The striped shape"" -> Unique.
*   ""The checkerboard shape"" -> Not unique.
*   ""The star"" -> Not unique.
*   ""The green shape"" -> Not unique.
*   ""The blue shape"" -> Unique.
*   ""The red shape"" -> Unique.
*   ""The black shape"" -> Unique.

Combining features is key. ""The star with dots"" would be unique. ""The green star"" would also be unique.

I'll lean towards the pattern as the main distinguisher, as it's the most salient. ""The star with dots inside"" is a solid choice. Also, ""The green star"" is another good one. Let's provide one description that is a combination of color and pattern.

Therefore, the best description will be: ""It's the green star with dots inside."" I can also say ""The star with dots inside"", or ""The green star"". The best one may be to use the pattern as the primary feature, it is the most robust and unique.

Hence, I'll go with: ""The star with dots inside."" or maybe ""The star that is filled with dots inside."" I'll stick with ""The star with dots inside"" since it is concise and specific.

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object clearly enough that someone else can pick it out. First, I need to take a good look at the image. It's a 3x3 grid. Some cells are empty, some have objects, and some are covered by red curtains with question marks. The target is helpfully indicated by the red dashed box (but I can't mention that!).

I see three things: the target triangle in the top-left cell, a checkerboard square in the top-right, and two covered cells. The target is a triangle, black-outlined, with a grey and white wavy line pattern inside. The distractor square has a checkerboard pattern and a red border. The curtains...well, I have no idea what's behind them, so I have to consider all possibilities there.

The key is to focus on what makes the target unique. It’s a triangle with a wavy pattern, while the other visible object is a square with a checkerboard. So, what’s the simplest, most robust way to describe it? I need to avoid ambiguity and to assume anything could be behind the curtains.

""The triangle with the wavy pattern inside."" That works. It is clear and concise, it captures the shape and the internal pattern. I could also say ""a triangle filled with a wavy pattern"", or ""triangle with wavy lines inside."" It is important not to mention the border color, or the location.

I think the best option would be ""The triangle with the wavy pattern inside."" It hits the right balance between being precise and easy to understand. It covers both the shape and the internal pattern. It's concise and should uniquely identify the target object.

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My task is to describe this target object so someone else can pick it out from the grid. Let's break this down.

First, I see a 3x3 grid. Some cells are empty, some have objects. Two have red curtains with question marks - hidden. I see a checkerboard pattern, a green square with gray and white checks. Then, there's the target: it's a circle. It's inside a red circular border. And inside that circle are vertical gray and white stripes. I need to describe *that* without using location like ""bottom right.""

I have to identify the *unique* features that distinguish it. The checkerboard is the primary distractor, so a simple ""the one with the stripes"" is a good start.

The key features of the target are its shape (a circle), its pattern (vertical stripes), and the red circular border. The main distractor (the checkerboard) is a square shape, with a checkerboard pattern, and a green square border.

I considered a few options, like ""It's the circle with stripes"" or ""The circle with a red outline, and it's filled with vertical stripes."" But I need to be clear and concise.

The simplest approach could be ""The circle with vertical stripes."" The distractor is a square with a checkerboard, so that works. I could be slightly more robust and say, ""The circle with a red border and vertical stripes inside."" But for efficiency, I'll go with a concise and clear description which will isolate the object from any other: ""The object is a circle filled with vertical stripes.""

exp2_039.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,"triangle, triangular",blue,"wavy, zigzag","3,1",It's the triangle that is filled with a wavy line pattern.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object within this grid so that someone else can identify it. First, I have to analyze the visual information. The image is a 3x3 grid, and I can see some of the cells are empty or partially obscured.

The target object is in the top-right corner; I see it has a red dashed box around it, which means it's the target. It's a triangle with a blue border filled with a grey wavy line pattern. Now, I need to consider other visible elements: there is a square in the top-left with a blue border and grey dots, an empty cell in the top-middle, a circle in the middle-left with a green border and wavy lines, an empty cell in the middle-middle, two cells obscured by red curtains with question marks, an empty cell in the bottom-right and, finally, another triangle in the bottom-middle with a blue border and grey dots.

To describe the target, I have to think about what makes it unique. Simply saying ""it's a triangle"" is not enough, as there's another triangle in the grid. ""It's a triangle with a blue border"" isn't sufficient either, because two other shapes have a blue border. ""It's filled with wavy lines"" is good, but the circle also has a wavy line pattern. ""It's a triangle with wavy lines"" is getting better. That feels like a very strong description. The other triangle has dots, and the other wavy-line object is a circle, which gives a clean distinction.

I have to consider the hidden objects. The person I'm communicating with *can't* see what's behind the curtains. I need to be careful. What if there's another triangle with wavy lines hiding? To minimize ambiguity, let's combine all of the features. The best description is ""the triangle with a blue border and a grey wavy line pattern"".

I think the most important thing is to be concise and accurate. ""Select the triangle with the wavy line pattern inside"" is a strong description. It contrasts with the other triangle, which has dots, and the other wavy-pattern shape, which is a circle. ""It's the shape with a blue border and a wavy line pattern"" also works, in that it distinguishes against shapes with a different border and shapes with a different fill. ""The blue triangle with the wavy pattern"" is also a strong possibility.

I need to make sure I am most specific.

To be sure, I will compare the target to all other items in the grid.
*   Target: Blue-bordered, triangle, wavy fill.
*   Distractor 1: Blue-bordered, square, dot fill.
*   Distractor 2: Green-bordered, circle, wavy fill.
*   Distractor 3: Blue-bordered, triangle, dot fill.

The comparison comes down to this: *the fill pattern* will differentiate the triangles. ""The triangle with the wavy fill"" is the best. The shape also differentiates it from the circle and the color and the shape differentiates it from the square.

Now, I will compose my final sentence, and use *all* features.
""It's the triangle that is filled with a wavy line pattern."" is clear and precise and, with no identical hidden items, that should be enough.

exp2_040.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,square,blue,stripe,"1,3",The square with vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with acting as a speaker in a reference game. My primary objective is to clearly describe a target object so that another person can accurately select it from a set of distractors. I need to be as efficient as possible while avoiding any ambiguity.

First, I need to thoroughly analyze the target object. It's a square with a blue outline and grey vertical stripes, and it's located in the bottom-left of the grid. But, I cannot use its location because the listener might have a different setup. I should only use the characteristics of the object.

Next, I look at the distractors. There is a green circle, a blue triangle, a green triangle, and a blue circle, all with various stripe and pattern fills. These are the objects I need to differentiate my target from.

Now, it's time to formulate a description. The target's square shape immediately stands out because it's unique among the shapes presented. Two other objects share the blue outline and the vertical stripes feature. So, ""the square"" seems like a promising starting point. I could also say ""the blue square,"" but that has less meaning when the listener only sees the shapes of the objects. ""The square with vertical stripes"" could work too.

I start evaluating different strategies. ""The square"" is concise, but maybe too brief. I could add the blue outline or vertical stripes, making it ""The blue square"" or ""The square with vertical stripes"". ""The blue square filled with vertical gray stripes"" is descriptive but I want to be concise.

The shape feels the most discriminating. ""The square"" is efficient because there is only one square. ""The blue square"" is a good second option. ""The square with vertical stripes"" is also good.

I need to make sure my descriptions are not ambiguous. So, ""the blue square"" works and ""the square with vertical stripes"" works. It's safe to say ""the square"" alone.

I check for any instructions. It's important to not use location based clues. I will use the shape and at least one other property. I have a list of objects I can choose from, which are the distractors, and I will make the most efficient choice for them.

My final thought is that describing the shape is the most efficient and unambiguous way to start, so ""Select the square"" is my primary choice. To make my description extra robust, I can add another feature. To be completely sure, I'll combine the shape with a color or pattern. A good description is ""The square filled with vertical stripes"". This feels natural, and I am confident that it is completely unambiguous.

exp2_041.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,"circle, circular",red,dot,"3,1",Select the circle with the red border.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm in a reference game. The user wants me to be the speaker, my goal is to pick the right object. I'm given an image to analyze, and I need to craft a description so the other person, the listener, can select the target object. It's a 3x3 grid, and there are some objects and some empty spaces.

My first task is to break down the image. I see circles filled with grey dots, some covered by curtains (hidden to me, but visible to the other person). One circle has a thick black border, and the target – highlighted with a dashed red square – is a circle with a red border and grey dots.

Now, to identify key features. I see the target is a circle filled with grey dots and the crucial distinguishing feature, a red border. I need to focus on this red border, because it will be the most obvious way to differentiate the target from other objects. The other circle is nearly identical, except for its black border.

The hidden objects are irrelevant for now, as I only have access to what's visible to me. I need to ensure my description avoids spatial references (top-right, etc.), as the listener may view the scene differently.

The key to a good description is concise clarity. The simple description ""The circle filled with dots that has a red border"" seems perfect. I could expand it (""Select the circle with the red border.""), but the added detail risks unnecessary elaboration. The listener knows that there are only two circles filled with dots, and the difference is obvious from the borders.

I should check the description. Does it *uniquely* identify the target? Yes. Does it rely on spatial location? No. Is it clear and concise? Yes. Therefore, the description ""The circle filled with dots that has a red border"" will be perfect. I need to keep it simple, direct, and unambiguous, and it should work.
"
exp2_042.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,"circle, circular",red,"wavy, zigzag","3,3",Select the circle that has the wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Selecting the Target Object**

Okay, here's how I'm approaching this reference game. The goal is to guide the other person to select the correct object, which is highlighted by a dashed red box. I can see the target, but they can't. Importantly, I can't rely on spatial terms (""bottom right"") because the arrangement might be different for the other person. Let's start by analyzing the image.

It's a 3x3 grid with four objects and five empty spaces. I need to identify the target object by describing its features. The target is a circle with a red outline and a wavy gray pattern inside. Now, I need to figure out the best way to describe this uniquely. I am comparing it with the other objects in the grid: a red-outlined star with stripes, a black-outlined square with a wavy pattern, and a black-outlined star with dots.

My first thought is, is there a shortcut? Is the target the only circle? Yes. So ""Select the circle"" should work, and be very concise. However, it's always good to be thorough.

Is there another object that shares a feature with the target? The other object with the red outline is a star with stripes, and the other with a wavy pattern is a square.

I could say, ""Select the circle that has a red outline"" or ""Select the circle with a wavy pattern inside"". However, I should check whether there's any other object that's *both* a circle and has a red outline or a wavy pattern, just to be sure. There isn't. So, all these descriptions are unambiguous.

The most basic feature is shape, so I could just say ""Select the circle"". But I want to be *extra* clear. So, ""Select the circle with the red border and the wavy pattern inside"". Or, ""Select the circle that has a red border and wavy pattern inside"".

Since the goal is an instruction, let me make it very direct: ""Select the circle filled with a wavy pattern."" This uses the shape, but adds a bit of unique visual detail. Or ""It's the red-outlined circle.""

Let me be absolutely certain. Is the target the *only* circle *and* the *only* object with a wavy pattern? Yes. So, ""Select the circle with a wavy pattern"" should be perfect. I think this description combines the salient feature (shape) with a strong visual characteristic (the wavy pattern), making it both clear and efficient. I am going to be certain. Yes, all other objects are distinct based on either shape or pattern or both. It's the best option here.
"
exp2_043.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,star,green,"wavy, zigzag","1,1",Select the green star that has a wavy pattern inside.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being asked to be the speaker in a reference game. I'm given an image of a 3x3 grid with various shapes, and a red dashed box highlights the target object. My task is to describe this object so the listener, who sees the whole grid, can identify it. I need to be clear and concise, without relying on spatial terms like ""top left"" since the listener might see a different arrangement. Importantly, there's a possibility of objects being hidden behind a red curtain, although that isn't relevant in this specific example.

First, I need to understand the visual information. The target is a green-outlined star with a grey wavy pattern inside. I need to note the distinguishing characteristics: the shape (star), the outline color (green), and the inner pattern (wavy lines).

Next, I need to identify and analyze the distractors - the other objects in the grid. I see another green star with vertical stripes, a red-outlined triangle with vertical stripes, a red-outlined square with vertical stripes, and a black-outlined circle with a grey and white checkerboard pattern.

The critical step now is forming a descriptive phrase that uniquely identifies the target. My initial thought, ""the green star,"" is too ambiguous because there are two green stars. I need to differentiate. The key to differentiating it is the inner pattern. One star has wavy lines, while the other has vertical lines.

I consider several options:

*   ""The green star with the wavy pattern inside."" This feels good, concise, and accurate.
*   ""The star with the green outline and a gray, wavy fill pattern."" Also works.
*   ""There are two stars with green outlines. Select the one with the wavy lines inside, not the one with the straight vertical lines."" While clear, this feels a bit wordy.
*   ""The star filled with wavy lines."" This works, but I think the outline color is probably redundant, though it could be helpful as a cross-check.

I've considered all the features of the object, compared them to all the other objects, and I've come to a pretty good descriptor. ""The green star with the wavy pattern inside"" is clear, concise, and effectively distinguishes the target. The phrase highlights the defining inner pattern within the broader description of the object. It narrows the possibilities, and then specifies the defining characteristic. So that is what I will use!
"
exp2_044.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,square,red,dot,"1,3",The object you're looking for is a square filled with grey dots.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game. My objective is to describe the target object so someone else can pick it out, but without using spatial references – ""top left"" is out. The target, indicated by the dashed red box, is what I need to focus on. The challenge is that there are objects I *can't* see hidden behind curtains. Let's see...

First, I need to break down what I *can* see. There's a 3x3 grid. Visible objects are a green circle with grey dots, a green circle with vertical grey stripes, and the target: a square filled with grey dots.  The red box is irrelevant to the description; I just need to describe the object.

I need to nail down the essential features of the target. It's a square. Inside the square are grey dots arranged in a grid-like pattern. That's the core. It is visually distinct from the circles based on the shape. Also, the pattern distinguishes it from the striped circle.

Now, let's consider potential ambiguity. Is ""the object with grey dots"" sufficient? No, because there's *also* a circle with grey dots. So, I need to combine the shape and the fill pattern. ""The square filled with grey dots"" is the basic descriptor.

But what about the hidden objects? I have to account for any *possibility* of an object with the same features. If there's another square with grey dots behind a curtain, then my description is no longer unique. If there's a square with stripes, that's fine. If there's a circle with dots, the same. My description remains solid because it specifically calls out *square*, which the other objects are not.

Thinking about the visible elements, I have a shape dimension (circle vs square) and a pattern dimension (dots vs stripes). I need to describe the object with a shape and pattern dimension.

""The square"" isn't enough; it doesn't distinguish the target from a potential hidden square. ""The object with grey dots"" isn't enough, because there are two objects with grey dots. Thus, I need to be more specific.

I also note the difference in outline – the circles have a green outline, the square does not. This could be a good distinguishing feature.

I've considered several options: ""The square filled with grey dots,"" which is accurate. ""The object that is a square and is filled with grey dots"" is more verbose. ""It's a square with a pattern of grey dots inside."" The idea is to be as specific as possible, but also concise.

However, I will use ""the square"" for the shape and ""grey dots"" for the fill, so I need to combine them. I will also incorporate the absence of a green outline (implicit to ""the square"").

Finally, my conclusion is to be as specific as possible and to be as specific as possible about the shape and pattern. ""It's the square shape that's filled with grey dots."" This is both clear and accurate, clearly stating both the shape (square) and the pattern (grey dots), the two distinguishing properties. I can't guarantee there isn't another identical object hiding behind a curtain, but I've done my best to differentiate it from everything I *can* see.

exp2_045.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,"triangle, triangular",black,stripe,"2,1",The triangle with vertical stripes.,"**Reference Game Strategy - Thought Process**

Okay, here's the situation: I'm playing a reference game. My goal is to guide the listener to select the correct object. I've got a checklist to make sure I don't screw up. The key constraints are: no spatial language (because the listener's view might be different) and to be robust to potentially hidden objects.

First, I need to understand the scene. There's a 3x3 grid, and I can see three objects in the middle row. One is a striped star, one is a striped triangle (the target!), and one is a wavy-lined circle. They all have thick black outlines. Got it. The target is the dashed-boxed triangle.

Now, let's identify what makes the target unique. Clearly, it's the *shape* that is the most distinct. The star and the circle have different shapes. The triangle is the only triangle. The vertical stripes are shared with the star, and the wavy pattern is unique to the circle.

So, I need to describe the target clearly. The simplest description would be ""the triangle"" - the shape alone works. However, to be more robust, I could also say ""the triangle with vertical stripes."" The pattern distinguishes it from the circle and makes it more distinct if the listener can not see the other objects clearly. Even if the listener misidentifies a shape, the ""vertical stripes"" narrows it down if they have access to visual hints.

Comparing the options, ""The triangle with vertical stripes"" is slightly more descriptive and unambiguous, even if it is a bit redundant. It makes sure that the listener is on the correct page regardless of their potential mistakes. ""The triangle"" is also sufficient because it's the only triangle, but ""The triangle with vertical stripes"" might be a bit more robust if they might misidentify shapes. 

I'm checking patterns again. Triangle and Star have vertical stripes, Circle has wavy lines. The target's shape is the key differentiator. So, the description *must* include the shape.

The best description, and the one I'm choosing, is: ""The triangle with vertical stripes."" It's precise, unambiguous, and covers potential errors.
"
exp2_046.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,star,red,"wavy, zigzag","2,1",The star with the red outline.,"**My Approach to the Reference Game**

Okay, so I'm presented with a reference game. My task is to clearly describe a target object within a field of distractors so that someone else can correctly identify it. I'm going to break this down methodically. First, I need to understand the target.

1.  **Object Analysis:** Alright, the target is a star, it's enclosed in a red dashed box, has a red outline, and is filled with a grey and white wavy pattern.

2.  **Distractor Analysis:** Now for the other objects. I see a green-outlined triangle with the same wavy pattern, a red-outlined triangle with grey dots, a black-outlined square with the wavy pattern, and finally, a black-outlined star also with that wavy pattern.

3.  **Feature Differentiation:** The core of this is finding the *discriminating* features. ""The star"" won't do, there are two. ""The object with the red outline"" is also insufficient, as a triangle has that feature as well. The wavy pattern is too common, shared by several distractors.

4.  **Feature Combination & Refinement:** So, the key is to combine these features uniquely. I can see the target's *red outline* and the *star* shape. The other star has a black outline. The red-outlined triangle has a different shape (triangle) and different fill (dots). The other wavy objects have different outlines (green and black). Okay, ""the star with the red outline"" is uniquely identifying. I'm sure of this because the other star has a black outline.

Let me think a bit about robustness. What if there are more objects?

-   ""The red object with the wavy pattern"" is too ambiguous, since it could refer to the triangle's outline.
-   ""The wavy-patterned star"" is not good enough as there are two.

So, the optimal description is ""The star with the red outline."" It's concise, accurate, and, most importantly, uniquely identifies the intended target object.

Finally, I remember the rules: no spatial references like ""the one in the middle"" and I need to assume my visible grid is the entire context. The combination of shape, outline color, and fill pattern should be robust enough, even if there are hidden objects. I'm confident in ""The star with the red outline.""
"
exp2_047.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,square,green,stripe,"1,3",The green-bordered square with vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process on Describing a Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game and need to describe this target object for someone else to identify. The object is inside a red dashed box, which is my cue to focus on it. The key is to describe it accurately so they can select it, without using spatial cues since their view might be different. I have to be aware that there are objects hidden behind a red curtain that they can see but I cannot. This means my description must be clear enough for them to eliminate the visible options, and then check against the hidden ones.

Looking at the image, I see a 3x3 grid, though some cells are merged or empty. Within it, there are three visible things: a circle with a checkerboard pattern and a black border, a square with a dotted pattern and a green border, and my target, which is a square with a vertical stripe pattern (grey and white stripes) and a green outline, highlighted. The hidden objects are represented by a red curtain with question marks.

My task is to specifically describe the square with vertical stripes. So, I need to break down its defining features: shape (square), pattern (vertical stripes), colors (grey and white for the stripes, green for the outline). I should compare to the other objects as this object is different. The other objects are a circle, and another square. The others have different patterns (checkerboard, dots) and outlines (black, green).

I have to make sure my description is unique. “The square with vertical stripes” sounds promising, since no other visible object has that. ""The object with grey and white vertical stripes"" also seems clear. Since another square has a green outline, I can use ""The square with a green outline and vertical stripes"", which is even more specific, but it feels a bit much. The most important difference between the objects is the stripe pattern.

Now, about the hidden objects. If one of them is *also* a square with vertical stripes, my description would be ambiguous. But, I can only describe the visible ones. So, I have to give the best description I can, based on the information I have. The stripe pattern is the most distinguishing feature, compared to the other visible objects.

Let me think of a few descriptions. Maybe, ""Select the object that is a square filled with vertical grey and white stripes."" Or, ""It's the square with the vertical stripe pattern."" Maybe ""The object with grey vertical stripes inside a green square border."" All good. No spatial language.

I need to make sure my description doesn't rely on their color perception being the same. ""Grey"" and ""white"" seem pretty standard, and ""green"" is pretty clear for the border. ""Vertical stripes"" should be clear too, as the other patterns are dots and checkerboard.

Now, let's compare the target to the other visible objects: The target is a square, vertical stripes, green border. The other square has dots, green border. The circle has a checkerboard, black border. So, the key differentiator between the two squares is the pattern: vertical stripes vs. dots. And comparing the target to the circle involves shape, pattern, and border color.

Hmm, a really minimal description would be ""the one with vertical stripes"". Since none of the other *visible* objects have that, this should work. But, ""the square with vertical stripes"" is better, just in case a hidden object is a circle with stripes. “The square with a green border and vertical stripes” is even better to distinguish from something that might be a striped square with a different border.

I think ""The square with vertical stripes"" is a good balance. So, let's make it more precise. ""The object is a square with vertical grey stripes and a green border."" That is very clear. Let's make it conversational, maybe ""Look for the square that's filled with vertical grey stripes. It also has a green outline."" That's perhaps too long, though. This game values brevity.

So, for now, let’s go with a simple direct description. ""A square with vertical grey stripes and a green border."" That clearly identifies the target among the visible ones. The other person can see the hidden objects so they will have to assess those also.

Another option: ""The green-bordered square with vertical stripes."" That feels good and concise. It's different from the green-bordered square with dots. It also distinguishes it from the black-bordered circle with a checkerboard.

Yup, that is my choice. ""The green-bordered square with vertical stripes."" Clear, accurate, no location dependencies. Let me double-check the rules: I'm the speaker, I want the other person to select the target, their arrangement might be different, some objects are hidden from me, target is in the dashed box.

Okay, the target"
exp2_048.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,square,red,stripe,"3,3",Select the square that has a dashed red outline.,"**Reference Game Speaker Thoughts**

Okay, the goal is to describe this target object so the other person can pick it out. I need to be precise and unambiguous. First, let's analyze the image. It's a 3x3 grid with four objects visible: a star, a circle, and two squares. The target object is highlighted, which helps. It's the bottom-right cell in the grid and is a square with a dashed red outline and gray vertical stripes.

My initial thought is to describe the highlighted object directly. It's a square. I can't just say ""the square"" because there's another one. They both have gray vertical stripes, so that doesn't help me distinguish them. The key difference is the outline. The target has a dashed red outline, while the other square has a solid blue outline.

I'm thinking, ""Should I just say 'the square with the red outline?'"" But wait, the star also has a red outline! So, no, that could be ambiguous. ""The dashed outline"" also works, but I need to make sure I consider the possibility of objects hidden from my view, but not from the listener. So I should be descriptive.

Now, I'm analyzing the other objects, the distractors. I need to ensure my description singles out the target. The star is a red outlined shape, the circle is black, the other square is blue. Okay, let's try a few descriptions: ""Select the square with the dashed red outline."" That's concise and unambiguous. ""The object with gray vertical stripes and a dashed red border."" Is also good. ""It's the square with the dashed outline."" This is precise. Let's make it the most direct and unique.

After considering everything, the most important features seem to be the *dashed* outline and the red color. The most distinguishing features compared to the other square are its outline color and style. The most distinguishing feature from all other objects is the dashed outline. So, I will go with ""The square with the dashed red outline."" That's the most robust and avoids ambiguity.
"
exp2_049.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,square,green,stripe,"1,1",The object with vertical stripes and a green border.,"**Analyzing the Reference Game Scenario**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game, which is straightforward. The system wants me to help someone identify a target object in an image. I see a red dashed box highlighting it, but the recipient doesn't, so I need to provide a description. Critically, there are hidden objects behind curtains, and that adds a layer of complexity I need to consider. My primary goal is to provide a description that unambiguously identifies the target object, *given the information I have*, considering the potential for hidden objects to introduce ambiguity. I need to be careful with spatial references.

First, I'm breaking down the image. It's a grid. I'm taking inventory of the visible objects: a striped green-bordered square (the target), a checkerboard-filled green-bordered star, and a striped black-bordered square. It's a simple visual task.

Now, the crux: forming the best description. I'm focusing on features that differentiate the target from the visible distractors. ""Square with a green border"" and ""vertically striped object with a green frame"" feel like the strongest contenders. They hit the key discriminators: shape, fill, and border color.

Let's dissect this. ""The green border"" alone isn't enough, since the star has one too. ""Vertical stripes"" alone is too vague, since there is another object with vertical stripes. So, the green border combined with shape *or* fill, is key.

My focus is to ensure the other person can identify the object, but I *cannot* know the hidden objects. So, it's best to be as direct as possible, while taking the potential ambiguities into account. I can't guarantee anything about the hidden objects, so I'll create a description that uniquely identifies the target, given the visible objects.

Therefore, ""The square with a green border"" feels the most concise and effective description that's still clear and unambiguous, given the known parameters. It's a direct combination of shape and border color, both of which distinguish the target. The *green border* combined with *either* the *shape* *or* the *fill* pattern is the key. That's my final conclusion.
"
exp2_050.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,star,red,stripe,"2,3",It's the star with vertical stripes.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to guide the listener to the correct target object. I need to be precise, but also as efficient as possible with my description. Let's break down my thought process:

First, I need a good understanding of the entire scene. I see a 3x3 grid, a bunch of objects and a target object, clearly marked. The key is to compare the features of the objects in the grid. I'm focusing on features that make it distinct from the other objects in the grid. There are two ""hidden"" objects behind red curtains with question marks. I can't directly describe them, but I'll need to consider that the listener *does* know what's behind those curtains.

Next, I identify the features of my target object, the star. Shape: Star, obviously. It has a red outline and grey and white vertical stripes. I also see a circle with a green outline and dots.

Now, I start crafting my description. My primary goal is to uniquely identify the star. I can't assume that the listener knows anything about the grid. Initially, I'm thinking ""the star"". But, am I being too simplistic? I'm imagining how the listener might be visualizing the scene. The listener will select the target object and the goal is to make that as simple and quick as possible. Maybe I need more details. ""The star with a red outline"". Or, ""The star filled with vertical stripes"".

I start refining. Is ""the star"" enough? If one of the hidden objects is *also* a star, it's not. I've got to be safe and unambiguous. ""The star-shaped object with a red outline and vertical stripes inside."" That's solid. It's a combination of unique characteristics. Could I simplify it? ""The star with vertical stripes"" is pretty good, and the stripes are a pretty distinct feature when contrasted with the dots on the circle.

What's the *most* efficient way to say this? ""The star"" on its own... it's concise, but am I taking a gamble? If the listener sees a different grid, it's not. The listener should be able to make a confident selection, so, I'll hedge on the side of caution.

I'm thinking about the most robust and natural-sounding way. ""Select the star with the vertical stripes,"" or ""It's the star that has vertical stripes inside it."" That's good. In the end, the most effective description will combine the salient features to make the selection unambiguous.

Finally, after all that thought, I'm thinking, ""The object that is shaped like a star and has vertical stripes inside."" This description is concise, and it explicitly focuses on the features that make the target object distinct: it's shaped like a star, and it has vertical stripes. This should be clear and effective, and hopefully, I've considered all the possible ambiguities. That's the one.

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My goal is to describe a specific object in this 3x3 grid so that someone can identify it. They're an expert, so I need to be precise, but not overly verbose. Also, I can't use spatial terms like ""bottom-center,"" which forces me to focus on the object's inherent characteristics.

First, I need to *understand the visual information*. I see a 3x3 grid with four objects. I note what's in each visible cell: a green circle with grey stripes, a red star with grey dots, a black star with grey stripes, and the target object, which is highlighted with a dashed red box. The remaining cells are empty. Interestingly, the prompt mentions a ""red curtain with a question mark,"" but I don't see that. So, I have to assume the listener may have a different perspective or that some elements are intentionally occluded.

Next, I *identify the target object*. It's clearly a triangle. Its outline is thick and black, and the inside is filled with grey wavy lines.

Then, I *identify the distractors* - the other objects in the grid: the green circle with grey stripes, the red star with grey dots, and the black star with grey stripes.

Now comes the crucial part: *formulating a distinguishing description*. I have to create a description that differentiates the triangle from those distractors. Shape is key here. It's the only triangle. The outline color, black, isn't enough, as one of the stars shares that. The fill pattern is unique; the wavy lines are distinct from the stripes and dots.

I have to *combine these features into a clear and concise description*. Starting with the unique shape, ""It's a triangle"" should be enough. Then I can consider additional robustness. Maybe, ""It's a triangle with wavy lines inside."" This seems strong, and avoids any ambiguity. Adding the outline's black color is an option. ""The object is a triangle with a black outline and a wavy pattern inside.""

I should *review the description against the constraints*. No spatial terms are used. By focusing on intrinsic properties, my description will work even if the listener has a different view. Since the triangle is unique and the wavy lines are, the description appears unambiguous.

Finally, the *utterance*: I'm going to choose the most concise yet robust description. While ""The triangle"" would likely work, I'll add the pattern, since that is also unique. ""It's the triangle with the wavy line pattern inside."" This is sufficiently detailed and avoids any room for confusion. I am satisfied with ""The triangle with the wavy line pattern inside.""

exp2_052.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,"triangle, triangular",black,checker,"2,1",It's the triangle with a checkerboard pattern inside.,"**My Strategy for Object Identification**

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game, and my task is to describe an object, the one in that red dashed box, so someone else can identify it. I need to be precise, clear, and unambiguous. Let's break this down systematically.

First, I need to *really* look at what I'm describing. It's a triangle. A basic geometric shape, but that's crucial. It also has a thick black outline, and inside, there's a checkerboard pattern. The squares of the checkerboard are alternating grey and white. Got it.

Next, I need to consider the *other* objects visible, because the description has to distinguish the target from them. There's a circle with a thick black outline, filled with vertical grey and white stripes. There's also a square with a thick black outline, and it too is filled with a grey and white checkerboard pattern. Then there are those two squares covered by a red curtain. I have no idea what's behind them, and that's the tricky bit.

Now, formulating the description. I have to make sure the listener can clearly tell the triangle from the other visible objects. The unique feature is its shape. *None* of the other things are triangles. I also need to consider the pattern. A checkered pattern is shared by the square in the bottom right, so just saying ""the checkered object"" would be ambiguous, especially if another checkered object is hidden behind the curtains.

The best way to differentiate it is by combining the shape and pattern. ""The triangle with a checkerboard pattern"" seems to be the obvious best choice. But what about the hidden objects? I have to make sure my description still works even if there's something else hidden. Let's run a quick check: Is there another triangle? Not that I can see, but possibly. Is there another checkered object? Yes, the square, but the triangle is still distinct.

""The checkered triangle"" is a very concise, but accurate, description that will separate it.

I'll check for ambiguity and refine. The shape and pattern description is good because it won't depend on location. It accounts for potential hidden objects as well. Describing the shape *and* the pattern makes the description very specific, so it minimizes the chance of another *checkered triangle* being behind a curtain. The shorter, the better.

So, let's go with ""The triangle with a checkerboard pattern"". That should do the trick. That should be unambiguous, easy to say, and gets the point across. The description needs to be as concise and clear as possible.

exp2_053.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,"triangle, triangular",red,stripe,"1,1",The triangle filled with vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with acting as a speaker in a reference game. My primary objective is to describe this target object so that another person can pinpoint it correctly.

First, I need to understand the visual layout. I see a 3x3 grid, but only a 3x2 section is used. There are four objects in total, all with blue outlines, except for the target, which has a red outline. The target, indicated by a red box, is in the top-left, and is a triangle filled with grey vertical stripes. The other objects are a blue-outlined, dotted square; a blue-outlined, striped square; and a blue-outlined, dotted star.

The target, obviously, is that striped triangle with the red outline. Now, I need to come up with a description that's both efficient and unambiguous.

I consider different features. “The triangle” sounds good, as there's only one. ""The object with the red outline"" is equally viable because the color is unique. However, just ""the striped object"" won't work since there are two striped objects. So I can't just say the striped object.

I begin to combine features for more clarity: ""the red triangle"" is a good one, or ""the striped triangle"". Those seem like excellent combinations. ""The red striped object"" also works, which is more descriptive, as well.

I’m instructed to be mindful of ""degenerate spatial locations,"" which is good, meaning I can't just say ""the top-left one."" I'm also told to ignore the ""hidden objects"" prompt because there aren't any hidden objects.

The most concise descriptions are ""the triangle"" and ""the object with the red outline."" However, combining features, such as ""red triangle"" or ""striped triangle,"" is also good for redundancy, so the listener can't miss anything.

""The triangle"" is clear, and so is ""the red outline"". I need to avoid using ""the striped object,"" since that's ambiguous.

Now, I look at the other shapes, there’s another square, and a star. There is only one triangle in the image, so ""the triangle"" alone works fine. There’s also only one object with a red outline, so that works as well. There are two striped objects (one blue and one red), so the striped description is not a good choice.

Therefore, the best descriptions would use the unique shape or the unique outline color, which could be simply ""it's the triangle"" or ""it's the one with the red outline."" I can combine features, for example ""It's the red triangle"" or ""The triangle with the red outline"" also works.

Considering the simplicity, I am more inclined to describe the fill pattern: “The striped object”.

The instruction mentions hidden objects; I should probably provide a more robust description, assuming there might be other triangles visible to the listener.

Therefore, I have an idea. ""The red triangle with vertical stripes"" provides maximal specificity. Pairs also work: ""the red triangle"" and ""the striped triangle"" or ""the red striped object"". Of those options, ""the striped triangle"" sounds good.

Let me think about this. The target is red, is a triangle, and has vertical stripes.

Shape, ""triangle"" is unique. Color, ""red,"" is unique. The pattern, ""striped,"" is not unique because there's also a square that is striped.

So, the most efficient ones are ""the triangle"" or ""the red one."" But, given the instruction about potential hidden objects, I should probably provide more than the minimal information. ""The striped triangle"" is good because it distinguishes from the ""striped square."" The ""red triangle"" distinguishes from any potential blue triangle. ""The red striped object"" does the same, as the other striped object has a blue outline.

I will start with a shared property and disambiguate with a unique one. This is a common strategy in reference games. But this might be too long. ""The triangle that is filled with vertical stripes"" works. Let's see if there is another efficient way. ""The object with the red outline"" works well, and is also very efficient! But I should consider the ""hidden objects"" prompt.

If there is a hidden red object, ""The object with the red outline"" may not work, or there's a hidden triangle, and ""The triangle"" would not work. Therefore, combining the features is safer.

So I need to come up with one description and stick with it. I will go with ""The striped triangle"". It’s a very clear description and easy to understand.

exp2_054.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,"triangle, triangular",green,checker,"2,1",The triangle with the checkerboard pattern.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game and need to describe this target object so someone else can pick it out. First, I need to *really* understand the object. It's inside a dashed red box – that doesn't really factor into the description, it just provides a visual cue for me. The object itself is a triangle, with a green outline and a grey and white checkerboard fill. It's sitting in the top row, middle column, but I shouldn't use location in my description.

Now, I look at the distractors. There's a green square with stripes, a black triangle with stripes, a black star with stripes, and a black square with dots. The prompt mentions a red curtain, but there's no red curtain, so I can ignore that. My job is to find what makes the target object *uniquely* identifiable.

I consider the options. ""Triangle"" alone is useless, there's another one. ""Green"" is also not enough, as there's also a green square. However, ""green triangle"" works well. Now I consider the pattern. No other object has a checkerboard pattern. So that seems to be a strong contender. ""The object with the checkerboard pattern"" could be a good starting point.

I start formulating descriptions. ""The green triangle"" is concise. ""The object with the checkerboard pattern"" is also concise. I could combine features for added clarity: ""The green triangle with the checkerboard fill"". But maybe that is too wordy. I want to keep it simple, and robust.

I need to make sure I don't introduce ambiguity. I'm imagining the listener might misperceive the colors. The pattern seems very distinct, and it seems to be the one unique feature.

I'm leaning towards the pattern. ""The object with the checkerboard pattern"" feels safe because it's the only one of its kind. Alternatively, ""the green triangle"" works as a good starting point. Let's start with ""the checkerboard pattern"".

I want to avoid being too wordy. The simpler the better. ""The green triangle"" works. ""The triangle with the checkerboard pattern"" works too.

I will use the fill pattern as the most unique feature. It's visually salient. No other object shares this feature.

So, let's say ""The object with a checkerboard pattern"". Or, ""The green triangle.""

""It's the shape with the checkerboard pattern."" I could also say ""The green triangle.""

I'll lean towards the pattern as it's the most unique feature.

I need to make sure this is robust. Thinking about colorblindness, ""the green triangle"" might be a problem. ""The triangle with the checkerboard pattern"" avoids that issue. This covers the triangle. It's better than ""the shape with the checkerboard pattern"" since it specifies the triangle, making it easier to spot.

Ultimately, I'm going with: ""The triangle with the checkerboard pattern."" This covers the critical features uniquely identifying the target object. It's clear, unambiguous, and avoids potential issues.

exp2_055.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,"triangle, triangular",blue,dot,"3,3",The object is a triangle with a blue border and a pattern of dots inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object clearly enough that someone else can pick it out. Let's break this down.

First, I need to analyze the scene. It's a 3x3 grid, and I can see three objects: a square, a circle, and the target object, which is a triangle. The square has a checkerboard pattern and a blue border. The circle has a dotted pattern (grey dots) on a white background and a black border. The target triangle also has the dotted pattern, and a blue border. The other cells are empty. The target is highlighted with a red dashed box, but that's for me and not part of the description.

Now, I'm focusing on the target: it's a triangle with a dotted pattern and a blue border.

I need to identify distinguishing features. Shape is key here. It's a triangle, and the others are a square and a circle. So, shape is the most distinctive feature. The dotted pattern is shared between the triangle and the circle, but the circle has a black border, and the square has a checkerboard. The blue border is shared with the square, but the square is not a triangle.

So, I have to formulate a description. I need to make it unambiguous. I need to avoid ambiguity caused by hidden objects (even though I can't see any here, the instructions mention this possibility, so I need to keep that in mind).

""The triangle"" is the most direct description. Is that enough? Given the context, probably. However, adding more details would reduce the possibility of misunderstanding.

I could say, ""The blue triangle filled with dots."" That's clearer, encompassing shape, border color, and pattern. Or I could say ""the blue triangle with a dotted pattern inside."" That is good. The other blue-bordered object (the square) has a checkerboard pattern, and the other dotted object (the circle) has a black border.

I have to consider if describing it as a triangle is enough (given that there's only one triangle visible). The instructions are for a ""reference game,"" so clarity and efficiency are important. ""It's the triangle"" *should* be enough. But to be safe, I should be a little more specific. I could say, ""The triangle with the dotted pattern,"" which differentiates from the other objects. Or I could say ""The triangle with the blue border"". Combining features is safest.

I need to focus on the key features that distinguish the target from the other visible objects. It's a triangle. The square has a checkerboard pattern, and the circle has a black border. So, let's go with, ""The triangle with the blue border and the dotted pattern."" It's concise and precise. That leaves no room for confusion. ""The object is a triangle with a blue border and is filled with grey dots."" This is the best description.

Let me think of a slightly more conversational option. Maybe: ""The shape you're looking for is a triangle. It has a blue outline and is filled with dots."" I like that.

I can just say ""It's the triangle"". Adding additional information, however, offers more clarity.
I will describe its shape, border color, and internal pattern. This is as clear as possible.

**My final choice: ""The object is a triangle with a blue border and a dotted pattern inside.""**
"
exp2_056.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,"triangle, triangular",blue,"wavy, zigzag","3,2",The blue triangle.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the goal is clear: I need to describe a target object in an image so that someone else can identify it. This is a reference game, so precision and clarity are paramount. Let's break down the process.

First, I need to *analyze the image*. It's a 3x3 grid, and there are four visible objects. I see a red triangle with grey dots, a blue triangle with grey wavy lines (the target, highlighted), a green circle with grey dots, and a red circle with grey wavy lines. No spatial location language is allowed, and there are no objects hidden behind curtains as far as I can see, so I have to assume the listener sees all four objects.

Next, I *identify the target object*. It's a blue triangle with a grey wavy line pattern. This is my starting point. Now, the key is to pinpoint what makes it *unique* amongst the others.

I have to *identify the other objects (distractors)* to understand what features distinguish the target. The red triangle is the same shape but different color and pattern. The green circle is a different shape and color, but has a grey dot pattern. The red circle has the same wavy pattern, but a different shape and color.

The goal is to formulate a description that helps identify the target. I need to select features that are the same.

Now, it's time to *formulate a description*. Shape alone (""triangle"") is ambiguous, and the pattern alone (""wavy"") is ambiguous because there is another object with the same pattern. However, the color is unique: *it has a blue border and no other object is blue*. The combination of shape and color (""the blue triangle"") is also unique. Combining pattern and shape (""The wavy triangle"") is unique as well.

I can make a *constraint checklist*. 1. *Describe the target?* Yes. 2. *No spatial locations?* Yes, I'm avoiding phrases like ""middle right"". 3. *Hidden objects?* The prompt mentioned this, but there are no objects hidden behind curtains. 4. *Target highlighted?* Yes, but I can't refer to the highlight itself.

It's time to *choose the best description*. ""The blue triangle"" is concise and unambiguous within the set of visible objects. ""The triangle with the wavy lines"" is also unambiguous. I am going to choose that one.

I need to make sure my final utterance is clear and precise. I will avoid any ambiguity. To make my description maximally clear, I could say ""The object is a triangle with a blue outline and a wavy pattern inside."" It's descriptive and leaves no room for error. This would work. I can also be concise and say ""The blue triangle.""

Given that there are only a few objects, the unique features are clear. ""The blue triangle"" is shorter and still unambiguous, so I will choose it. It is clear that the target is the only *blue* triangle and therefore is distinct from the red triangle and both circles.

Therefore, the final description will be, ""The object is the blue triangle."" I'm confident that this is the most efficient and accurate description.

exp2_057.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,"triangle, triangular",blue,"wavy, zigzag","3,1",Select the triangle that is filled with a wavy pattern.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to describe the target object so that another person can pinpoint it accurately. This requires a methodical approach, and here's my thought process:

First, I need to understand the scene. It's a 3x3 grid, and I can see some elements are visible while others are concealed. The target, helpfully highlighted with a red box, is located in the top-right cell. It's a triangle with a bold blue border. Crucially, the internal pattern of the triangle is a grey and white wavy or zig-zag pattern.

Next, I take stock of the other visible objects. There's another triangle in the middle-left cell; this also has a blue border, but its interior is filled with a grey and white dotted pattern. There are also two mysterious cells hidden behind red curtains with question marks. These are unknowns, and will be known to the listener.

Now, I start to formulate the best description. I know I have to differentiate the target from any other object that's visible to me, and even consider what the listener might know. Simply saying ""the triangle"" isn't going to cut it, or just ""the blue triangle."" Both triangles have a blue border. The critical feature is the pattern *inside* the triangle. The target's pattern is wavy. Therefore, I need a description that highlights this.

I started brainstorming possible descriptions: ""It's the triangle with the wavy pattern inside,"" ""Select the triangle filled with wavy lines,"" and ""There are two triangles with blue borders. I want you to select the one that has a zig-zag pattern inside, not the one with dots."" The last one is more conversational, but the first two are simpler and to the point. I also considered ""The object is a triangle with a blue outline, and the inside is filled with grey and white wavy lines"" but it's more verbose.

Then I considered the context of the game. The instructions indicate that I should avoid using degenerate spatial locations, so no ""top right."" I want to be as direct as possible. I'm focusing on the discriminating feature, which is the wavy pattern, so, I will stick to ""The triangle with the wavy pattern inside.""

I run through a final mental checklist. Does this description uniquely identify the target among the visible objects? Yes, it clearly does. I also know there is the potential for other similar objects hidden from my view, but my description must be based on the information available to me. I need to be as clear as possible.

Therefore, my final description will be, ""**The triangle with the wavy pattern inside**"". This concisely highlights the key differentiating element. It's simple, clear, and unambiguous, and it should guide the other person directly to the target object.
"
exp2_058.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,"circle, circular",green,dot,"3,3",It's the green circle with grey dots inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game and need to describe this target object so the other player can select it. The target is highlighted by a dashed red box. My task is to provide the best description possible. I'm focusing on the visible items in the grid since I don't know what's hidden behind the red curtain.

Analyzing the image, I see a 3x3 grid. Some cells are empty, but the key items are: a star (red outline, grey wavy pattern) and the target. The target is in the bottom-right cell: it's a circle, green outline, and filled with a pattern of grey dots. I *must not* use spatial location terms.

So, the visible objects are the star and the target. This gives me a clear comparison point. What are the key differentiators?

1.  **Shape:** Circle vs. Star - huge difference.
2.  **Color:** Green outline vs. Red outline - also a good differentiator.
3.  **Pattern/Fill:** Grey dots vs. Grey wavy pattern - this is another important characteristic.

My approach: Build a description around these features, starting with the most prominent: the shape. I'm thinking of ""Select the green circle filled with grey dots."" This is clear to me, but I need to make sure the description holds up even if there are other circles hidden.

Let's do a quick mental test: Suppose there's another circle behind the curtain. If it's *not* green or doesn't have grey dots, my description works perfectly. Even if it's green, but doesn't have grey dots, my description works. If, by some improbable coincidence, it *is* the exact same green circle with grey dots, I am simply not able to select one from the other. This would be a game design flaw.

I'm thinking ""It's a circle with a green border and grey dots."" or ""the green circle filled with a grid of grey dots"". ""The object is a green circle filled with a grid of grey dots"" might be the most precise.

Now, let's compare:

*   Target: Circle, green outline, grey dots inside.
*   Distractor: Star, red outline, grey wavy lines inside.

Describing unique properties seems best. ""It's a circle."" might be enough on its own. Adding ""green outline"" makes it even better. Adding ""grey dots"" makes it complete. Combining these sounds like the best approach. My initial thoughts are: ""It's the green circle with grey dots inside.""

Double-checking the rules: I'm the speaker, need to describe the object within the red box, and no spatial location allowed, but I don't know what's behind the curtain. I need my description to work even with the hidden objects. Given I don't know what the hidden objects are, it makes sense to be as specific as possible. The listener has all the information about the board, so I need to make the target clear by its unique characteristics.

I will consider this from the listener's perspective. They know everything. The best-case scenario is the hidden objects do not overlap the description of the visible objects. In this case ""the green circle with grey dots inside"" is sufficient. If there are other circles, and if they are green and full of grey dots, the premise of the game is broken.

So, I will go with ""the green circle with grey dots inside."" It is simple, clear, and effective.

I considered other descriptions:

*   ""The object with a green circular outline containing a pattern of grey spots.""
*   ""It's the shape with a green border and polka dots inside.""
*   ""Select the green circle that contains a grid of grey dots.""

However, I will stick with the initial formulation.

My final check of the problem:

*   Role: Speaker in a reference game.
*   Task: Describe the target object (in the red dashed box).
*   Constraints: No spatial location, hidden objects exist for me.
*   Target object: Circle with a green outline, filled with grey dots.
*   Other visible object: Star with a red outline, filled with a grey wavy pattern.
*   **My planned description: ""It's the green circle with grey dots inside.""**

This is good. It covers shape, color, and pattern. It is precise and unambiguous. It accounts for potential ambiguity caused by hidden objects (given my limited information). I'm confident in this description.
"
exp2_059.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,star,black,"wavy, zigzag","2,1",It's the star with a wavy pattern inside.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object so someone else can identify it within a 3x3 grid. I can see the target object highlighted, which is a star in the top row, middle column. The key is to be clear and unambiguous, but concise.

First, I need to analyze the scene. The image is a grid with empty, visible, and hidden cells. The target is a star with a thick black outline and a grey and white wavy pattern inside. The visible objects are a triangle with a matching pattern, and a square with vertical grey and white stripes, and two objects hidden behind curtains.

Now, let's break down the features: the shape (star), the pattern (wavy lines), the outline (black), and the pattern's color (grey and white). I need to determine which characteristics are most distinguishing.

The star shape seems like the strongest starting point because it is unique among the visible objects. However, I need to ensure the description is robust against other objects, even if unseen. ""The star"" alone might be insufficient. While ""The object with the wavy pattern"" is potentially ambiguous because the triangle has the same pattern, ""The star with the wavy pattern"" seems specific enough to narrow down the target.

I can make it more explicit. While adding the outline and color is possible, it adds complexity. Given the limited context, going for a simplified description is the best option. I considered expressions like ""The star filled with wavy, horizontal lines."" or ""It's the star filled with wavy lines."" However, ""It's the star with the wavy pattern inside."" seems like the best balance of being descriptive and concise. It quickly rules out the triangle and square. I need to be careful with any locational references and focus on the distinct features of the target object. It provides enough detail without being overly verbose. So, my final choice is: ""It's the star with the wavy pattern inside.""

exp2_060.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,"circle, circular",red,"wavy, zigzag","2,1",It's a circle with a wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process for the Reference Game**

Okay, the goal is clear: I need to describe a target object in a visual grid so someone else can identify it, a standard reference game. The setup is designed to be slightly tricky, which is good. I need to be precise, but also avoid location-based cues because the other player's view might be different. I’m thinking about how to best leverage shape, color, and internal pattern differences, while ensuring my description is robust, given the potential for unseen objects.

First, I'm analyzing the provided information: I've got the original image and crops. I should focus on the original for context. There are visible objects – and potentially hidden ones. I need a description that’s robust enough to handle those possibilities. My primary role is to create a description for someone to select the correct object.

Next, I'm identifying the target: It's a circle. It has a thick red border and a gray internal pattern of wavy horizontal lines. That's the core of my description.

Then, the distractors. The star has a red border with vertical stripes inside. The square has a red border and a grid of dots. I'm focusing on the *differences* between these objects and the target, which will guide the description.

Now, I'm formulating a description: Shape is the most obvious differentiator – the target is a circle, clearly distinct from the star and square. However, the colors are shared. The gray internal pattern of wavy lines for the target, compared to the stripes and dots of the distractors, is the key distinguishing feature. I need to mention those.

My first draft is to use the shape as the main descriptor: ""It's a circle"". However, that might not be specific enough. Adding the pattern is critical: ""It's a circle with a wavy line pattern inside."" I'll then be adding color: ""It's a circle with a red border and a gray wavy line pattern inside.""

I then have to refine the description. Is ""circle with wavy lines"" unique enough? I can't know for sure, so it's best to be detailed. I should avoid anything related to spatial location (""next to"", ""above""). I'm sticking to the intrinsic properties of the object itself: shape, color, and pattern.

I’m checking now. Does my description refer to the right object? Yes. Is it ambiguous with respect to the visible distractors? No. Does it use any location information? No. It seems concise and clear, and very direct.

For my final utterance, I'm thinking a simple statement. Shape and pattern are the most critical features. My best options are something direct: ""It's a circle with a wavy pattern inside."" Another good choice is ""The shape is a circle, and it's filled with wavy gray lines.""

Let's combine it for the most robust summary. I am thinking, The object is a circle with a red outline and a gray, wavy pattern inside. I think that is it.

Okay, so I need to describe an object in a 3x3 grid for a reference game. My primary objective is to make the object identifiable to another person. I'm looking at a dashed red box. Let's break down my thought process.

First, I need to *really* analyze the target. It's a star located in the top middle square. The star's outline is green, and inside, it's filled with a pattern of vertical grey and white stripes. I've noted that!

Now, I've got to consider the distractors. There's a red-outlined triangle with horizontal wavy stripes in the middle-right square. The crucial thing here is the presence of the curtains. There are two squares with red curtains and a white question mark, in the middle-left and bottom-middle squares. This is key because I can't rely solely on distinguishing the object based on what I *can* see. The other person *knows* what's behind those curtains, and my description must uniquely identify the target object regardless of what's hidden.

Next, I need to *formulate a description*. I'll start with the most prominent feature: the shape. It's a star. Then I'll add the color: it's a *green* star, or, more precisely, it has a *green outline*. The internal pattern is the critical distinguishing detail – it has vertical stripes. The triangle has horizontal, wavy stripes.

Okay, let's draft a few options. I could say, ""Select the green star with vertical stripes inside."" That sounds pretty good. Or, ""It's the star with a green outline and a pattern of vertical grey and white stripes."" Maybe even, ""The object is a star. Its outline is green, and it is filled with vertical grey and white stripes.""

Now, for refining the description. Because the other person might have a different grid layout, I must avoid spatial terms like ""top"" or ""middle."" The instructions explicitly state this. Also, those curtains are a wild card. I need to assume there *could* be another green star hidden. It's less likely there is *another* green star with *vertical stripes* behind the curtains, but it is possible. So, being precise about all features is the best approach. My strategy is to be as specific as possible. The shape is a star, the outline is green, and the fill pattern is vertical stripes (grey and white).

I'll combine these features into a complete sentence: ""The object is a star with a green outline, and the inside is filled with vertical stripes."" I think this is comprehensive and unambiguous, differentiating it clearly from the triangle and hopefully also from anything behind the curtains.

I can also try phrasing it a bit more naturally: ""Select the star that has a green outline and is filled with vertical stripes."" Still, I can make it concise. ""It's the green star with vertical stripes."" The ""green"" applies to the outline, as it's the most prominent color feature. The pattern descriptor is ""vertical stripes,"" and that's the key distinction.

I think the safest and most accurate option is: ""The object is a star with a green outline and vertical stripes inside."" I think that is clear and sufficiently unique in this context. It's not the triangle (different shape, different outline color, different stripes), and it's hopefully distinguishable from whatever might be behind the curtains, because the fill pattern is specific. I'm going with that one.

exp2_062.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,square,green,dot,"2,3","The object is a square with a green outline, and it is filled with a pattern of dots.","**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with acting as a speaker in a reference game. My primary objective is to craft a description of a target object that will allow another person to select it correctly.

First, I need to analyze the target object. It's inside a dashed red box, which is irrelevant to the description. Focus on the object itself: it's a square with a green outline and filled with a grey polka dot pattern. Critically, it's located in the bottom middle cell of a 3x3 grid, but I'm told to avoid spatial locations.

Next, I need to analyze the other objects, or distractors, in the grid to identify unique features. There's a circle with a black outline, filled with grey dots. There is a triangle with a red outline filled with grey stripes. A circle with a blue outline filled with a grey wavy pattern. A triangle with a green outline filled with grey dots. Some cells are empty.

Now, I'll formulate a description that will allow me to single out the target, uniquely. I can start by listing its features.
*   Shape: It's a square. I'll consider if there are other squares. No. So ""the square"" is a valid descriptor.
*   Outline color: The outline is green. Is there another object with a green outline? Yes, the triangle in the middle-right cell. So just ""the green object"" is insufficient.
*   Fill pattern: The pattern is polka dots. Are there other objects with dots? Yes, the circle and the green triangle. So ""the dotted object"" is not enough.

Now, let's consider combining features:

*   ""The green square"": This sounds unique, but I need to make sure. There is only one square.
*   ""The square with dots"": Again, there's only one square in the grid.
*   ""The green object with dots that is a square"": This seems too specific, but it works.
*   The ""object in the bottom middle"": This is spatial, which I need to avoid per the prompt.

Now, I need to consider potential ambiguity for the listener. The listener might see the objects in a different arrangement. I'm told to avoid degenerate spatial locations. The listener might see objects behind red curtains that I can't see, which means I have to be careful with negative descriptions (like ""the only square""). Positive descriptions are usually safe.

So, which description is the best? ""The square"" is concise and potentially sufficient. ""The green square"" is more descriptive. ""The square filled with dots"" is also good, since it combines shape and pattern. I need to make sure the description works regardless of what the person is looking at. I'll compare ""the green square"" with ""the square filled with dots."" There is another green object. There are two other dotted objects. There is only one square. Therefore, the simple ""the square"" is the most efficient description based on the visible objects. ""The green square"" adds a confirming feature. ""The square with the dotted pattern"" is also a good one.

I'll choose ""The green square with dots,"" for clarity. But I must be careful with any ambiguous cases, so I will break it down to its unique features. The shape (square) is unique. Therefore, ""The square"" is a valid and minimal description. However, to be more helpful, and reduce any possible ambiguity, adding more features is better. Now, I try to find a distinguishing feature that isn't shared with any other object.

*   Shape: Square (unique)
*   Outline color: Green (shared with the triangle)
*   Fill pattern: Dots (shared with the circle and the triangle)

Since the shape is unique, referencing it is the strongest approach. I'll use the shape as the primary identifier and add another feature for confirmation. Description: ""The object that is a square."" Description: ""The green square."" Description: ""The square filled with dots."" All seem good. I'll go with a slightly more descriptive one to be safe. ""The square with a green outline and a dotted pattern inside."" This is unambiguous. I can shorten it to ""The green square with dots.""

Now, I need to think about a listener getting confused. If I say ""the green object,"" they might pick the triangle. If I say ""the dotted object,"" they might pick the circle or the triangle. If I say ""the square,"" they can only pick one object. This is the most efficient description. Perhaps the best strategy is to lead with the most unique feature.

""Select the square.""

Or, to be a bit more conversational:

""There is only one square, please select that one.""

I can't be sure there'"
exp2_063.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,2,"triangle, triangular",red,stripe,"3,2",The triangle that is filled with vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Selecting the Best Description**

Okay, so I need to describe a target object in a 3x3 grid, and I want to make sure my description is clear, concise, and robust, particularly because some objects might be hidden from my view, but visible to the listener. First, I analyzed the image. The target is a red-outlined triangle with vertical stripes. I also saw a black-outlined dotted triangle and a green-outlined square with vertical stripes.

My primary goal is to uniquely identify the target. I need a description that, regardless of what's hidden, will ensure the listener understands exactly which object I'm referring to. Location is out; I can't rely on relative positioning in the grid. I have to focus on inherent features.

Initially, I considered features in isolation. ""The red object"" works because the target is the only red object visible. ""The striped object"" doesn't, because it doesn't specify if it is the triangle or the square, so that's not specific enough. ""The triangle"" isn't enough, either, since there's another one.

Then, I combined features. ""The red triangle"" works. It distinguishes the target from the black-dotted triangle and the green square. The other one, the ""The striped triangle,"" is also unique. I've re-evaluated many times, considering that the listener might see objects I don't. This eliminates single-attribute descriptions like ""the red one"" if there's a chance of another red object.

Finally, I want the most effective description. Color seems salient, but the combination of shape and fill pattern is also a good choice. I want to convey as much as possible to be sure about the description. My preference is ""the triangle that is filled with vertical stripes"" to be clear. This is very descriptive: it relies on shape and pattern which make a reliable description.
"
exp2_064.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,star,red,dot,"1,2",Select the star filled with dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the goal is clear: I need to describe this object so someone else can pick it out, and I can't use spatial terms. Right, let's break this down. The target, which I can see because it has a red dashed box around it, is a five-pointed star. It's got a red outline, and the inside is filled with a pattern of grey dots on a light grey or white background.

There are also three other objects. There's a green-outlined triangle with a grey wavy line pattern, a blue-outlined triangle with the same wavy line, and a blue-outlined square with the same grey dot pattern as the target star.

I need to find the *most* efficient and unambiguous description. Let's look at what's unique. The star's shape is unique, obviously. The red outline is also unique because the others are green and blue. The dot pattern? Not so much, the square also has a dot pattern.

So, here's how I see the options forming:

*   **""Select the star.""** Simple and direct, and it *should* work. There's only one star.
*   **""Select the object with the red outline.""** Also good; only the star has the red outline.
*   **""Select the star filled with dots.""** This adds a bit more detail, and differentiates from the square.

I'm leaning towards something concise but clear. Using ""the star"" or ""the red star"" is enough, but to be absolutely sure, using the fill pattern in addition to shape is also a strong move. I don't want to be overly verbose. I don't want any chance of misunderstanding.

So, I think I'll go with **""The star filled with dots.""** This really hammers home both the shape *and* the fill pattern, so there's no confusion with the square, which shares the fill pattern. Although saying ""the star"" should be sufficient, adding the dotted pattern will be that final layer of protection.
"
exp2_065.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,square,blue,checker,"3,2",It's a grey and white checkerboard pattern inside of a blue square.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the highlighted target object so someone else can identify it. First, I need to understand the visual context. I'm seeing a 3x3 grid. I'm focusing on what's visible. I've got a red curtain with a question mark in one cell, a red-outlined star with a grey and white wavy pattern in another, and then the *target*. The target is what has a dashed red box around it, it's a square, it has a blue border, and inside is a grey and white checkerboard pattern.

The challenge? I can't use spatial terms like ""the one on the right"" because the setup might change for the listener. I also don’t know what's behind those curtains, so I need to be careful with my descriptions. My focus has to be on what *I* can see. The listener is going to use what I describe in conjunction with what they see.

So, I have to think about the salient features. The checkerboard pattern is quite distinct and the blue border is also a striking element. The star has a wavy pattern within a red outline, and the curtains are red with a white question mark.  I want to make my description unambiguous. I need to clearly differentiate the target from the other visible elements.

I could say, ""Select the checkerboard"", but that might not be sufficient if there's another hidden checkerboard. ""Select the object with the blue border"" is a strong clue because blue is unique among the visible objects. ""The grey and white checkerboard inside the blue square"" provides maximum specificity.

Ultimately, I want a description that's both concise and informative. I'm leaning toward combining the most distinctive features: the checkerboard pattern and the blue frame. So I'm settling on describing the target as ""It's a grey and white checkerboard pattern inside of a blue square."" I think that is sufficiently detailed and leaves little room for ambiguity, assuming that there isn't an identical hidden object. It's precise, focuses on visual elements, and should lead to correct identification.
"
exp2_066.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,"circle, circular",black,dot,"1,1",The circle filled with dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the task is a reference game. I need to describe this target object so another ""player"" can pick it out. The target is highlighted, so I can see it. No location-based descriptions; that's out.

First, let's analyze the properties: It's a circle, with a black outline and a grey dotted fill. Now I need to identify what distinguishes it from all the other shapes.

I'll go through the image object by object. The other shapes are a triangle, a circle, a star, and another triangle. I'm focusing on the *unique* combination of features.

*   **Circle:** There's another circle. Its outline is blue, and it has a wavy fill pattern. So, the target circle has the black outline and the dotted fill, which is distinct. ""The circle with the black outline"" or ""the circle with the dots"" immediately work as unique descriptions.

*   **Black Outline:** Another object also has a black outline—a triangle at the top. But this is a *circle*, so I can specify ""the black-outlined circle"".

*   **Dotted Fill:** There are *two* other objects with a dotted fill: a star and a triangle. Their outlines are blue. I can distinguish them from the target by referring to the shape as a circle.

I'm aiming for concise and unambiguous. ""The circle with dots"" seems ideal, emphasizing the fill, which is very different from the wavy lines of the other circle. ""The black-outlined circle"" also works, although the black-outlined triangle shares this feature. But specifying the shape, outline and fill, ""The black-outlined circle with dots"" is an unambiguous description. I have to avoid using words like ""the black circle"" as that can be interpreted as a solid circle.

Now I'll fine-tune. I need to select the most clear option. I'll compare the features I described in the text: Shape, outline and fill. It's the unique combination that makes it a special object.

* ""The dotted circle"" - distinct and concise.
* ""The black-outlined circle"" - very good. It's clear that it is not the other object with a blue border.

I will focus on the fill pattern and combine that with the circle shape, as that is the quickest way to differentiate between all other objects.

""The circle with the dot pattern"" is excellent, or ""the black-outlined circle with dots"" works just as well. But let's keep it concise, and simple: ""The circle with dots"" is the easiest and most clear description. The focus is on shape and the different fill patterns, as well as the color difference of the outline of all shapes.
I will go with the shortest, most salient description that is guaranteed not to cause confusion:

My final answer is: ""The circle filled with dots.""
"
exp2_067.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,square,blue,"wavy, zigzag","2,1",The square with the blue border.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to guide someone to the correct object. I need to give a clear and unambiguous description of the target, which is indicated by the dashed red box. Let's analyze this visually.

First, I see a 3x3 grid, but only a few cells are occupied. There are two hidden cells covered by red curtains, each with a white question mark. Those are irrelevant for now, but I'll keep them in mind; there might be another, similar object hidden there.

The visible objects consist of four elements. The cell I'm most interested in, (1,2), holds the target: a square with a blue border and a grey and white horizontal wavy pattern inside. There's also a square with a red border and the same wavy pattern in cell (2,3). The remaining visible cells are empty white squares.

The key is to differentiate the target object from the other similar visible object. Both have the same grey and white wavy internal pattern, but the crucial difference is the border color. The target has a blue border; the other one has a red border. That's the key differentiator.

Spatial locations, like ""top"" or ""middle"", aren't reliable, because the layout might change in a different instance of the game. So, I need a description independent of spatial position. I'm focusing on the *inherent* characteristics of the target object.

I'm thinking, ""The square with the blue border."" It's simple, direct, and unambiguous, given the context. The alternative of saying, ""The square with the grey and white wavy pattern and the blue border"" is also accurate but a bit longer. Since the only other visible, similar object has a red border, the shorter description should be sufficient. I am confident that the description ""The square with the blue border"" should do the trick.
"
exp2_068.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,star,black,stripe,"2,1",It's the star with the black outline and vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Selecting the Target Object**

Okay, here's how I'm thinking through this reference game. My objective is to describe the highlighted target object so the other person can identify it correctly. I need to be precise, avoiding spatial terms since the layout might be different for them. The critical thing is that I can only describe what I see; hidden objects are unknown to me, but the other person knows them.

Let's break this down systematically. I see a 3x3 grid with various shapes: triangles, and five-pointed stars. Some are filled, some are empty, and some are behind red curtains, which I can't describe, but I'm told the other person has this info. My focus is on the visible ones.

I've got a top-left triangle with a green border and grey dots, a middle-left star with a blue border and vertical stripes, a bottom-left triangle with a red border and a checkerboard, and importantly, my target is a star in the top-middle position. The target has a black border and vertical grey and white stripes, just like the other star on the left.

Now, I'm thinking about the *key* distinguishing features. There's another star, but it has a blue border. The triangles have different shapes and colors. My focus is on what makes the target unique *among the visible objects*. It's a star with a black border, and vertical stripes.

I have to consider the hidden objects. I can't know if a hidden item is also a black star, so I need to give the best description I can, based on what's visible. I've concluded that ""a star with a black outline and vertical stripes"" is a complete and accurate description of the target, *based on what I can see*. I'll assume they can deduce the target with the information provided.

Let's hone in on the clearest wording. I want to convey it in a conversational tone. So it's something like: ""I'm looking at a star with a black border. It's filled with vertical stripes."" The border color is key to making the distinction.

I could be even more concise: ""The star with the black outline."" This is precise because, among what I see, *only* one star has a black outline. The fill pattern just helps for confirmation, but isn't strictly necessary.

I will also make sure the context of the game is clear. I want to avoid ambiguity. Mentioning the other star could be helpful, like: ""There are two stars, both with vertical stripes. The one I want has a black border.""

I've reviewed the requirements, checked for spatial references (none), and considered the hidden information. My description focuses on what *I* can see, so it's a solid description.

My final thought is that the best description for the other person to understand is: ""The star with the black outline, and it's filled with vertical stripes.""
"
exp2_069.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,2,square,green,dot,"1,1",Select the square that is filled with dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object within this 3x3 grid so that another person can pinpoint it. I can't use spatial location as a clue; I need to rely on its visual features.

First, I examined the image. It's a grid with three objects visible: a green-bordered, dot-filled square in the top-left (my target); a blue-bordered, dot-filled triangle in the top-middle; and a blue-bordered, wave-filled rectangle/square in the middle-left. The other cells are empty.

My initial thought is, ""I need to isolate this square. What makes it unique?"" I need to consider shape, color, and pattern. The target is a square, it has a green border, and it's filled with grey dots.

Then I compared it to the distractors. The triangle shares the dot pattern. The other object shares the square shape. ""The square"" alone won't work, because there's another ""square-ish"" object. ""The one with dots"" is also not sufficient, because there's another object with dots.

However, ""the green border"" is immediately unique, as the other objects have blue borders. So ""the one with the green border"" is a strong candidate, it works really well and the description is concise and unambiguous. ""The square filled with dots"" is also a possible identifier. This could work well even if the person had color blindness. The waves are a distinct fill compared to the dots in the square.

I'm thinking, ""Let's refine that 'the square filled with dots' and make sure it is robust."" Okay, to really be safe, let's say ""select the square filled with grey dots"" for that level of detail. I can even be extremely explicit, ""There's a square filled with waves and a square filled with dots. Pick the one filled with dots"" is totally effective.

Okay, let's go with ""the square filled with dots"" as the best description. It clearly distinguishes the target from the other objects. It's concise and unambiguous, avoiding any reliance on spatial location. Perfect!
"
exp2_070.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,square,green,checker,"1,3",Select the square that has a green border and a checkerboard pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the highlighted target object so someone else can select it from the grid. Spatial locations are out, so I need to focus on inherent features. Also, I need to make sure I am unambiguous.

First, let's break down the target: It's in the bottom left, but I can't use that! It's a square. It has a green border, and the inside has a grey and white checkerboard pattern.

Next, I'll quickly look at the distractors. Top-left: A circle with checkerboard, black border. Middle-right: A star with wavy lines, red border. Bottom-middle: A circle with a checkerboard, red border. Bottom-right: A circle with vertical stripes, black border. There are some empty cells too. No red curtains with question marks. Good.

Now, let's formulate some descriptions:

My first instinct is ""The square with the checkerboard pattern."" Is this unique? Yes, it's the only square. That seems concise and efficient.

But to be super clear, let's add more details: ""The green-bordered square with a grey and white checkerboard pattern."" This *should* be very specific. Now let's double check those attributes against the others in the image.

*   Shape: Square. Unique.
*   Border Color: Green. Unique.
*   Inner Pattern: Checkerboard. Not unique; shared with the top-left and bottom-middle.

So, here's my strategy: using the shape (""square"") is the most efficient and unambiguous way to identify the target. ""The square"" would be enough. Border color (""green"") is also a unique identifier. ""The one with the green border"" would work. Combining them is great too. ""The green square."" I'm also ok mentioning the pattern, since ""the square with the checkerboard pattern"" is still unambiguous because there's only one square.

Okay, let's construct a few options and pick the best:

1.  ""Select the square."" - Short and sweet. Accurate, sufficient.
2.  ""Select the object with the green border."" - Accurate, and sufficient.
3.  ""Select the green square with the checkerboard pattern."" - Most descriptive, leaves no room for doubt.

I think option 3 is the most robust! It combines unique or almost unique features, so let's refine it a bit.

""The object is a square with a green border. Inside, it has a grey and white checkerboard pattern.""

Let's try a more conversational approach: ""There is a square with a green border and a checkerboard pattern inside."" That works, too.

Let's re-evaluate using *only* the shape: ""The square."" Easy. Any other squares? Nope. This works perfectly.

Let's re-evaluate using *only* the color: ""The one with the green border."" Is there any other green border? No. Perfect.

The goal is *efficient and accurate communication*, so let's check my options one last time.

*   ""The square""
*   ""The green-bordered object""
*   ""The square with the checkerboard pattern""

They're all correct and unambiguous, but I think I'll go with a slightly more descriptive option to be safe. Since I'm supposed to be a ""speaker in a reference game"", and mentioning the pattern adds context, even if it's not by itself unique.

How about: ""It's a square with a checkerboard pattern inside and a green border.""

Let's check for any remaining ambiguities. Are there other squares? No. Other checkerboard patterns? Yes, but only in circles. Other green borders? No.

The description is solid! It's a combination of shape, pattern, and color, which makes it very easy to identify the target. I think it will be a slightly more direct:

""There is a square with a green border and a checkerboard pattern inside.""
"
exp2_071.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,square,black,checker,"1,2",The checkerboard with the black frame.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm presented with this image – it's a 3x3 grid, but only the first two columns are populated. I'm being asked to play the role of a speaker in a reference game. My goal is to unambiguously identify a target object within this grid so the listener can identify it.

First, I need to break down what's in front of me. I can see a red curtain with a question mark in the top-left, a checkerboard with a black frame and dashed red box in the middle-left (this is the target), another red curtain with a question mark at the bottom-left, an empty cell at the top-right, another empty cell at the middle-right, and a second checkerboard pattern with a green frame at the bottom-right. The dashed red box is helpful, because it explicitly indicates the target object.

My next step is to nail down the target's crucial attributes. It's a checkerboard pattern, specifically with grey and white squares, but critically, it has a black frame. The dashed red box gives me additional support.

Now, I look at the distractors. The checkerboard with the green frame is the closest match, clearly the biggest issue. Those red curtains are present, but at first glance, appear very different from the target. They are likely covering more objects. I should formulate a referring expression that sets the target apart from these other objects.

I can't assume anything about the listener's perspective, so I *must* avoid spatial terms like ""the one on the left"". I need to latch onto the most salient feature that differentiates the target. The checkerboard pattern, in itself, isn't enough; both share that. The difference is the frame color! The target's black frame is the key differentiator.

So, I start building the utterance. I'll begin by stating the object type: ""a checkerboard."" Then, I'll add the distinctive feature, which is the ""black frame."" The two sentences will be combined into one coherent phrase. The final phrase, which must set the target apart from all other options, will be, ""the checkerboard with the black frame.""

I'll review the utterance to make sure it's good to go: It's accurate, it distinguishes the target from the green-framed checkerboard, avoids spatial terms, identifies the object type, and it's simple and easy to understand. I will send the phrase ""the checkerboard with the black frame"" back.

exp2_072.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,star,black,stripe,"3,2",Select the star with the black outline and vertical stripes inside.,"**My Analysis of the Reference Game**

Okay, so I'm being asked to describe an object in a 3x3 grid, a reference game, and select a target object within the grid. The goal is clear: I need to formulate a description that will unambiguously identify the target. I've got to carefully consider the objects, and the descriptions of those objects, within this grid to make sure I'm giving a description that is accurate.

First, I looked at the image, carefully noting what's present. There's an open grid, some empty spaces, and several objects: a star (the target), a circle with dots, and two objects hidden behind curtains. I need to take the known and unknown objects, and their possible visual features into account. I need to be exact, and know what to call those objects that are the most important.

My analysis of the target, the star, is that it's the target and has a thick, black outline and vertical stripes inside. The circle is a distractor, but a known one. The objects hidden are unknown - they could be anything! I *must* take that into account.

To build my description, I need to focus on unique features, the things that separate the target from the other potential candidates. Shape (star), outline (black), and internal pattern (vertical stripes) are the critical differentiators. I'll need to figure out how to describe the thing.

I thought about starting simple: ""It's a star."" That's good, but maybe not specific enough. I could say ""Select the star with the black outline,"" but is there another star? I need to be more precise, more descriptive.

I then considered what to say about the features. What's the best combination of words to create a description? I wanted to go with ""a star with vertical stripes,"" but is this too vague? I needed to avoid any ambiguity, even if the other person can't see the objects behind the curtains. I'm going to need to create a good description in this game.

I tried several phrasing options: ""Select the star filled with vertical stripes,"" ""the star with a black outline and vertical stripes inside,"" and ""the star that has vertical stripes inside."" The challenge is to be clear, concise, and definitive.

So, here's my plan: the black outline is good, but might not be unique if there are other stars. The stripes are what make it distinct. So ""Select the star with the black outline, filled with vertical stripes,"" is clear.

I'm settling on, ""Select the star with the black outline and vertical stripes."" That way, I identify the shape (star), boundary (black outline), and internal pattern (vertical stripes) which is unique. It's concise, unambiguous, and unlikely to be confused, even with the unseen objects.
"
exp2_073.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,star,green,stripe,"3,2",The star with a green outline and vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My goal is to help someone else pick out a specific object from a 3x3 grid. I need to describe the target star accurately and clearly, without giving away its position or using any information the other person doesn't have.

First, I assessed the scene. There's a grid, a few visible objects and some empty spaces. The visible objects are two stars, and two hidden objects are behind red curtains. The target is highlighted by a red dashed box, so I know which one it is!

I needed to break down the visible objects. There are two stars. One has a black outline and a black and white checkered pattern inside. The target star has a green outline and vertical grey and white stripes inside. There are also those red curtains, with a question mark on them. I can't see what's behind them, but it's important to be thorough in case there is a third star!

I need to create a description that’s specific enough to distinguish the target from the checkered star, but also robust enough to deal with the hidden objects. So, I zeroed in on the unique features of the target. I saw it had a green outline and vertical grey and white stripes. The other visible star has a black outline and a checkered pattern.

I considered a few variations. I could say ""the green-outlined star"" or ""the star with vertical stripes"", but these alone may be ambiguous if the hidden objects are stars. Combining the features is best. ""The star with a green outline and vertical stripes"" is a strong starting point. ""The star with a green border and vertical stripes inside"" is also great, but perhaps the word ""outline"" is better. Adding ""grey and white"" to further clarify the stripes makes it even better.

Ultimately, I want to be as clear and concise as possible. The final answer is the best! I decided to go with: ""The star with a green outline and vertical stripes."" This is accurate, unambiguous, and focuses on the most salient features of the target, without relying on spatial location. This should be an effective description.

Okay, so I'm being asked to play the role of a speaker in a reference game. My task is to describe an object in a 3x3 grid so that another ""player"" can select it. I need to be precise, concise, and unambiguous.

First, I need to take inventory. I see four objects: a star, a triangle, two squares, and five empty cells. The target I must describe is a square in the bottom-left corner, highlighted by a red box. It has a wavy pattern inside and a thick black outline.

I immediately identify the target and the distractors. The distractors are a star (dotted pattern, black outline), a triangle (vertical stripes, black outline), and a square (checkerboard pattern, red outline).

Now, to formulate a description. The most straightforward approach is to isolate the target's unique features. It's a square with a wavy pattern and a black outline. The wavy lines are really the most salient feature.

To be sure my description is effective, I mentally compare the target to each distractor. The star and triangle have different shapes. The key difference between the target and the checkerboard square is the pattern and the outline color.

I begin generating potential descriptions. ""The square with the wavy pattern"" is a good starting point. This should differentiate it from the other objects. I can also try the expression ""The object with the wavy pattern,"" since no other object has this pattern. Adding the black outline is a good idea to create a second distinguishing feature. ""The square with the wavy pattern and a black outline"" is robust, but I need to be as concise as possible.

The target’s shape, pattern, and outline color are all discriminators. The most efficient way to distinguish the target from the other elements in the grid is to rely on its unique pattern.

""Select the square that has wavy lines inside it."" This is a clear, concise way to specify the target.

I need to confirm my instruction avoids the use of spatial location, as per the rules. It also needs to be sufficiently clear and ensure that the recipient only selects the correct object.

After evaluating several options, I've landed on a simple but precise description: ""The square with the wavy lines inside."" This will clearly separate it from the star, the triangle, and the other square.
"
exp2_075.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,star,red,"wavy, zigzag","3,2",The star with the wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Selecting the Target Object**

Okay, the task is a reference game. I need to describe a target object in an image so someone else can pick it out. The target is highlighted by a red dashed box, which is helpful.

First, I need to analyze the visual scene. It's a 3x3 grid, and only three cells are populated. The target is in the center, a star with a red border and a grey and white wavy pattern inside. The other objects are a triangle (red border, checkered grey/white pattern) and a square (black border, grey/white vertical stripes). The rest of the grid is empty, but I don't know what might be behind curtains.

Now, I'm identifying key features of the target. Shape: star. Border color: red. Pattern: wavy or zigzag, and grey and white. I'll compare these to the distractors. The triangle is also red-bordered, so ""the red border"" isn't enough. However, the shapes and patterns are all distinct.

I must craft a description that uniquely identifies the star. Spatial location is off-limits. I want to minimize ambiguity. ""The star"" is simplest but could be problematic if there's another star hidden. The shape is the strongest feature, followed by the pattern.

Let's brainstorm. ""The star"" is simplest. ""The object with the wavy pattern inside"" also works. I could combine features: ""A star with a red border and a wavy pattern inside"" would be very specific. Redundancy is good here.

But I want the most concise and clear option. I check for any ambiguity. Considering the other objects, the pattern is unique. The shape is unique. ""The star with the wavy pattern"" seems like a solid compromise. Using both the shape and the internal pattern is the best bet for maximum clarity. The ""red border"" is shared, so it's not a strong identifier in this set.

Finally, ""The star filled with wavy lines"" is direct. Breaking it down: shape is unique, fill is unique, but the border is shared with the triangle. I could refer to either the shape or the fill. Combining both is safer, even if redundant. ""Select the star"" is direct, but ""the star with the wavy pattern inside"" is better. Ultimately, ""The star with the wavy pattern inside."" gives the best balance of being brief, and making sure the target is selected.

exp2_076.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,"triangle, triangular",green,stripe,"1,3",The triangle with vertical stripes.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to craft a description of a target object that will allow another person to select it accurately. The target object is visually distinguished by a dashed red box, which, of course, is just for *my* reference – the listener won't see this. I need to distill this visual information into a verbal description.

First, I need to understand what I'm looking at. I quickly identify the target object; it's a green triangle with vertical grey stripes inside. I also see other objects: a red star with a grey and white checkered pattern and a green square with grey dots inside.

My next step is to analyze the properties of the target object: its shape (triangle), its outline color (green), its fill pattern (vertical grey stripes), and the style of its outline (solid). I’ll then move on to the other objects to identify distinguishing features. The red star, for example, has a checkered fill, and the green square has a dotted fill.

Now for the crucial part: formulating a description. I need to be precise enough to eliminate any ambiguity. The shape ""triangle"" is already unique in this scenario. The fill pattern, ""vertical stripes,"" is also unique. Should I combine them? ""The green triangle"" might be a bit too generic, given the presence of the green square, so that's out.

I also have to keep constraints in mind: no spatial references like ""the one on the left"" are allowed and there are no hidden objects in this case.

I consider a few options: ""The triangle"", ""The shape with vertical stripes"", ""It has a green outline and vertical stripes inside."", and ""The triangle with vertical stripes."" The simplest description, ""The triangle"", is likely sufficient as it's the only one. However, combining the shape with the fill pattern is even safer to avoid possible confusion.

To choose the best description, I’m mentally simulating the listener’s perspective. I’m asking myself: Could there be any misinterpretations? ""The green shape"" would be ambiguous, but ""The triangle filled with vertical stripes."" is unambiguous and precise.

Therefore, my final choice is “The triangle filled with vertical stripes.” This description is robust, unambiguous, and directly targets the most prominent distinguishing features.

exp2_077.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,"circle, circular",blue,stripe,"1,3",Select the circle with the blue outline that has vertical grey stripes inside.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being asked to play a reference game. My task is to describe an object within an image so that someone else can identify it. Here's how I'm thinking through this.

First, I need to understand the image's structure. It's a 3x3 grid, and some cells are empty or covered by curtains. The target object is highlighted, which is helpful. Now, I zero in on the object itself. It’s in the bottom-left cell and it's a circle. It has a blue outline, and inside, there's a pattern of vertical grey stripes.

Next, I need to consider the other visible objects – the distractors. I see two triangles with different internal patterns and outlines. There are also two red curtains with question marks, concealing objects in the middle-left and bottom-right cells.

My primary goal is to create a description that differentiates the target from everything else, including what's hidden. The obvious approach is to leverage its unique features. A circle stands out immediately, since triangles are the only other shapes present. So I'll start with that. But I also need to be precise, especially given the hidden objects.

I'll start with, ""It's a circle."" Then I'll add the blue outline and the vertical grey stripes to refine the description.

However, I have to account for the unknown, i.e. the objects behind the curtains. What if there's another circle hiding? It might have a different outline color or a different internal pattern. I need to formulate a description that remains unambiguous.

My assessment is that a blue outline and vertical grey stripes are going to be unique to the target object. It's improbable that a hidden circle would match both the outline and pattern.

So, I need a description that combines these features. Shape is the most important distiguishing feature, then the pattern, and then the outline color.

Finally, I'll go with: ""It's the circle with the blue outline and the vertical grey stripes inside."" That seems clear and specific, regardless of what's behind the curtains. No use of spatial locations is used. It should be good to go.
"
exp2_078.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,"triangle, triangular",red,stripe,"2,1",It's the triangle with the red border.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the goal is clear: provide a description that lets someone else identify the target object. It’s a reference game, I'm the speaker, and I've got to be precise. Let's break this down. First, I see a grid. It's a bit irregular, more like a 3x2 grid really, with that bottom-left cell taking up two columns. Got it. Now, what's in front of me?

I have to pinpoint this one triangle with the red border.  I'm looking at it in a 3x2 grid. The target is smack dab in the middle of the top row, highlighted by the dashed box.  My brain immediately wants to compare it to the other objects around it. The other items are really distractors. There is a green triangle with grey stripes, a square with green and grey, a star with grey and white stripes, and that curtain with the question marks. Those hidden objects are not part of my description because I do not see them.

My mind starts looking at what distinguishes it. ""Triangle."" There's another triangle, so that's not enough on its own. “Color.” The target has a red border. That feels promising. Another triangle has a green border. Bingo!  It also has gray stripes like the green one, so stripes are not unique either. The square has dots, and the star has vertical stripes that alternate between white and gray.

I can't use spatial location as my primary way to describe the target. No ""top middle."" That's out.  I'm building a description.

*   ""The triangle with the red border.""  Clean, direct, and distinguishes it immediately from the green one.
*   ""The red object"" The curtain is red. I do not see the curtain as a simple shape like this. It is still a red object. But that's probably too vague. There's a shape in a red border!
*   ""The red-bordered triangle.""  A slight variation, same meaning. ""The triangle with the red border and grey vertical stripes"" It's accurate, but maybe too detailed?

I need to be concise but unambiguous. The description has to isolate the target object, and the border color does that because it differentiates from the green one.

What if there's something *behind* the curtain? I don't know what's there, but I need to make the description safe. So I do not want to suggest that there is only one red object, as that may not be true. The listener has the view, so I cannot assume that my view is complete. I should only mention what I see! The best I can do is describe the visible features of the target.

I think the best and safest approach is: **""The triangle with the red border.""** or **""The red-bordered triangle.""** It's immediately clear, and focuses on the most salient differentiating feature. That's a good place to start.
"
exp2_079.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,"circle, circular",green,dot,"3,2",Select the green circle with the grey dots inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being asked to play a reference game. My task is to describe this target object so someone else can pick it out. Let's break this down. First, I need to analyze the target object. It’s a circle with a green outline and filled with grey dots. It's in the middle row, second column. *But* I shouldn't mention the grid cell. The prompt specifically told me not to mention the red dashed box either, so I'll ignore that.

Next, I have to consider the other objects present so I can distinguish the target. There’s a blue square with grey dots, a black star with grey dots, and a red star with grey dots. There's also a blue circle, but it has grey wavy lines inside. Hmm, there are empty cells too, but the instructions say some objects may be hidden, so I can only use information from what *is* visible. I can't rely on the absence of objects to define the target, only its characteristics.

Now, I need to find a way to describe this object that’s clear and unambiguous. Let's look for what makes it unique. The green outline is unique. No other object has that color. The dot pattern is present in other objects, but combined with the circle shape, and especially the green outline, it *is* unique.

So, I start drafting expressions. ""The circle with a green outline"" seems concise and good. ""The green circle with grey dots inside"" is more descriptive. ""The object with a green outline"" also works, as green is unique. I could say ""the circle filled with grey dots"", but that's ambiguous because other objects have the dots. ""The green object"" is also simple and effective.

Let’s go through these. ""The circle with a green outline"" is very clear. ""The green circle with grey dots inside"" combines two features: shape and color. It's robust. The ""green"" part distinguishes it from the blue circle, and the non-green stars and square. The ""grey dots"" distinguish it from the blue circle with wavy lines.

I need to make sure there's no confusion. Is ""green"" likely to be confused with ""blue""? Nope. ""Circle"" with ""square""? No. ""Dot pattern"" with ""wavy lines""? Nope. I'm aiming for the most efficient and unambiguous description, so I'll start with the unique ""green"" element. The dot pattern itself is *not* unique since four other objects have them.

Okay, let's refine and try some different phrasings. The unique features are the shape *and* the color. To distinguish from the other circle, I can say ""the green circle"". To distinguish from the other dotted objects, I can say ""the green object"" or ""the circle"". Combining them is even better. ""The green circle"". ""The green circle with grey dots.""

So, the simplest and most direct way to distinguish the target is through its unique color. But adding the shape makes it clearer. Adding the pattern solidifies it even more.

Finally, I'll go with a clear, single sentence. ""Select the green circle with grey dots inside."" It's perfect. No room for misunderstanding.

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My goal is to describe a target object within this grid so that someone else can identify it. Here's how I'm approaching this:

First, I'm analyzing the image. I see a 3x3 grid with different shapes and patterns in each cell. The target object is clearly highlighted for me by this dashed red box, and it's in the bottom middle cell.

Now, I'm breaking down the target. It's a triangle. It has a blue outline. Inside the triangle, there are grey dots on a white background. It's important to remember that this dashed red box isn't visible to the other person, so I can't refer to its position directly.

Next, I'm looking at the distractors in the grid. There's a square with a blue frame filled with a grey and white checkerboard pattern. This is somewhat similar because of the blue frame and grey/white pattern, but the shape is completely different. There's also a star with a black outline and a grey and white checkerboard pattern. It shares the grey/white pattern concept, but not the shape or outline color. Crucially, two cells have red curtains with question marks. I have no idea what's behind them, and I need to make sure my description is precise enough to select the correct object, regardless of what's hidden.

Now, I'm formulating my description. I have to avoid any ambiguity, and I know I have to be specific. Saying ""the triangle"" might not be enough, since I can't see the full board. Saying ""the blue triangle"" improves it, but I need to make sure the description is robust. Describing the filling pattern is also a good idea. So, combining features is key: ""a triangle with a blue border filled with dots"".

I need to refine the description and make it contrast the target object with the others. The star has a checkerboard pattern, not dots. The blue-framed square also has a checkerboard pattern, not dots. So, the dots are a unique feature of the target within the visible objects.

Therefore, the shape is unique among the visible objects. The outline color is shared with another object.

Putting it all together, I want to start with the most prominent feature, the shape, but add other details for clarity. ""Select the triangle,"" or ""It's the only triangle."" Then I'll add more detail: ""It has a blue outline."" The most distinguishing feature from the other patterned objects is the dot fill pattern. So ""It is filled with grey dots."" A concise summary would be, ""The object is a triangle with a blue border and is filled with grey dots.""

The other option is to focus on the pattern: ""Select the object filled with dots."" Since there might be another dot pattern, behind the curtain, I need to add shape and outline color. ""Select the triangle filled with dots,"" or ""Select the triangle with a blue border that is filled with grey dots.""

I'm doing a final check. The description doesn't rely on position, which is good. It's specific enough to separate it from the star and the checkerboard square. It also should be specific enough to distinguish it from the hidden objects, given the combined features. Therefore, I've got to ensure the best description possible. I'll go with ""The triangle with the blue outline is filled with grey dots."" It's accurate and provides a lot of detail.

exp2_081.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,"triangle, triangular",green,checker,"2,1",The triangle filled with a checkerboard pattern.,"**My Thought Process on Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being asked to describe an object in a reference game. My goal is clear: I need to pick out a specific item from a set and clearly describe it so another person can identify it without seeing the actual image. I've got to be as precise as possible, especially since I can't rely on spatial location.

First, I looked at the target object: It's a triangle. Its outline is green, and the fill is a grey and white checkerboard pattern. Good starting points.

Next, I examined the surrounding objects. There are circles with stripes and polka dots, another triangle with wavy lines, all with green outlines. Crucially, there's also a circle with vertical stripes. Now, the prompt mentions potential ""hidden"" objects behind a red curtain, but I don't see one in the provided image. Since I can't assume anything, I will only consider the visible items.

I then did a comparison. The shape, triangle, isn't enough to distinguish it, as there are two. However, the checkerboard pattern is unique among all the visible objects.

The key to a good description is clear differentiation. I could start with the shape. ""It's a triangle"", but then I need to get more precise. ""It's *the* triangle"" won't cut it. Adding the fill pattern is the most obvious way to differentiate it: ""the triangle with the checkerboard pattern."" Also saying it's the ""green triangle"" helps.

I refined the wording, considering conciseness and clarity: ""The triangle with the checkerboard pattern."" That's direct and gets to the unique feature quickly. I considered whether I need to mention the green outline, but it's redundant. If someone can't find it, they're probably not looking for the triangle.

The core of my approach is: 1) What is the object? 2) How is it different from the other objects?

Finally, despite the prompt's hint of a ""hidden"" object (which I cannot see), the image has no curtains or any other indicators of a hidden object, so I should work with the visible information only.

My best description to be *as unambiguous* as possible will be: ""The triangle with the checkerboard pattern."" That's all the other person should need to find the correct object.
"
exp2_082.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,"triangle, triangular",green,stripe,"2,1",The green triangle.,"**Analyzing the Reference Game**

Okay, here's the breakdown of my thought process. The task is to describe a target object in a visual reference game so someone else can identify it, given the constraints of potentially hidden items. I'm focusing on the need to be unambiguous, even with those unknown elements.

First, I examine the setup: a 3x3 grid with a target object (green-outlined triangle with vertical stripes) and a distracting object (black-outlined circle with vertical stripes) in view. There are also two hidden objects behind red curtains; their identity is unknown. I must avoid using spatial terms like ""top middle"" or ""to the right"".

Next, I meticulously break down the features of the visible objects: shape, outline color, and fill pattern. The target is a green triangle; the distractor, a black circle. Both have vertical stripes. My initial thought is the unique features are shape (triangle vs circle) and outline color (green vs black).

Then, I address the crucial issue of the hidden objects. They could be anything – any shape, color, or pattern. This means a description like ""the triangle"" or ""the green object"" is insufficient, as the hidden items could be those too. This necessitates combining descriptive features to create a more robust description.

I consider combining the unique features of the target object: shape and color. ""The green triangle"" immediately stands out as a strong candidate. It is a combination of two things the distracter does not possess. I evaluate this choice: would there be a hidden item that is a green triangle? Possible, but unlikely. I evaluate if I could say ""the triangle with vertical stripes."" The distracter already has vertical stripes.

Then, I evaluate the best combination. ""The green triangle"" seems the most efficient combination of features that uniquely identifies the target, given the visible information.

I then consider other descriptions like ""The green triangle with vertical stripes."" This is more precise, but is it necessary? It adds a descriptor that is not unique amongst the items. Given the game's goal of pragmatic communication, I determine ""The green triangle"" to be the most efficient solution: it's concise, unambiguous given the visible context, and resilient to most hidden object possibilities. It focuses on the key differentiating features: shape and outline color.
"
exp2_083.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,star,red,dot,"3,3",Select the star with a red outline that is filled with dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game and need to describe this target object so the listener can pick it out. The image is a 3x3 grid, and I've got to ensure my description is precise enough to select the correct item, considering the listener's view might be different and they might be shown items that are hidden from my view.

First, I analyzed the scene: there's a square with green stripes, a triangle with red stripes, a circle with a checkerboard, and a star with a red outline filled with dots—the target. The dashed red box highlights the target for *me*, but it's not part of the description.

I ran through a mental checklist. I'm the speaker, I need to describe the target, and I need to consider that the listener's arrangement could be different and they have potentially hidden objects. Confidence level is high, 5/5. So location-based descriptions are out. That means I need to focus on *features*.

I then came up with several strategies:

*   Describe the shape: ""Select the star."" Short and sweet, but is it *unique*?
*   Describe the fill pattern: ""Select the object filled with dots."" This seems distinct.
*   Describe the outline color: ""Select the object with a red outline."" Risky, because the triangle also has a red outline.
*   Combine features: ""Select the red star."" or ""Select the star with dots inside."" or ""Select the star with a red outline and a dotted fill."" These are the most specific.

I weighed these strategies: ""Select the star"" seems efficient but could be ambiguous if there are *other* stars, especially with something hidden. ""Select the object filled with dots"" is also sufficient because it's the only one with dots.

The prompt mentioning hidden objects behind a red curtain drove me to be more specific. I realized that if I just said ""Select the star"" and the listener sees two stars, I'm stuck. So, I need to combine features like shape, outline color, and fill.

I considered what's *truly* distinguishing: the star's shape and the dotted fill pattern. The red outline is helpful but shared with the triangle. I ran through descriptions: ""The target is a star with a red outline and is filled with grey dots."" Then, refining it, I realized that ""grey dots"" is probably overkill. ""The target is a star with a red outline, filled with dots"" is pretty good. ""The dotted star"" is also good, concise.

Let's test it: What about the other objects? Green striped square, red striped triangle, blue checkerboard circle. My description, ""a star with a red outline and filled with grey dots,"" completely differentiates it from the other objects in the image.

The shape (star) is unique. The fill (dots) is also unique. Red outline is secondary. I then refined it further, trying to choose the most efficient and unique description, thinking, ""Select the star."" is good, but ""Select the object with dots"" is also good.

Combining these seems best, to be as robust as possible. ""It's a star filled with dots."" I could also say ""It is a star with a red outline, and it's filled with dots."" I decided to mention all the features to be extra safe: ""Select the star with a red outline that is filled with dots."" It's specific and leaves little room for ambiguity, even if hidden objects are present. This description covers all the bases.

exp2_084.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,"circle, circular",black,"wavy, zigzag","2,1",The circle with the black border.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to help someone identify a specific object, and in this instance, it's a circle in a 3x3 grid. I'm focusing on providing the most unambiguous description possible.

First, I need to understand the visual context. I've taken note of the image: a 3x3 grid where some cells are empty, some hold objects, and some objects are hidden behind red curtains with question marks. In the visible cells, I see a circle with a green border and a wavy grey pattern (top-left) and a triangle with a blue border and a grey/white checkerboard pattern (middle-left). The dashed red box highlights the target: a circle with a black border and a wavy grey pattern (top-middle).

Now, the crucial step: identifying the distractors. The other circle is the obvious primary distractor. The triangle is present, but its shape differentiates it. The hidden objects are potential distractors, though I'm limited in my ability to use them in the description.

Next, I formulate my description. The key challenge is to distinguish the target circle from the distractor circle. I consider common properties like the shape (both are circles) and the internal pattern (both have a wavy grey pattern). The *distinguishing* property here is the border color: the target has a black border, whereas the distractor has a green border.

Based on this analysis, I brainstormed several utterances. First, ""It's a circle with a grey wavy pattern inside"" – too vague, since it describes both circles. Then, ""It's the circle with the black border"" – concise and unambiguous. ""Select the circle that has a black outline and a grey wavy pattern inside"" is another viable description, a bit more verbose. ""The wavy patterned circle with the black border"" is a good option too.

After a refining phase, I honed in on the essential elements. The border color is the most crucial differentiator; it immediately separates the target circle from the other visible object. The shared attributes, being a circle and a grey wavy pattern, aren't sufficient. This leads me to my final and preferred description: ""The circle with the black border."" It's direct, precise, and leaves no room for confusion in the user's mind. The listener can find the two circles and quickly pick the one with the black border.

Finally, I performed a check: I'm not using location in my description to avoid any ambiguity, I'm not referencing the hidden objects, and the description is completely unambiguous, clearly singling out the target circle. Therefore, I'm confident that ""The circle with the black border"" is the best way to describe this object.

exp2_085.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,"triangle, triangular",green,"wavy, zigzag","1,2",It's a triangle with a green border and a wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My goal is to describe a specific object in an image so someone else can pick it out. Let's break this down systematically.

First, I need to *analyze* the visual scene. I see a 3x3 grid; some cells have objects, others are empty. The object I need to describe is highlighted with a red dashed box.

Now, *identify* the target object precisely. It's located in the second row, first column of the grid. It’s a triangle, and it has a thick, green border. Inside the triangle is a pattern of horizontal grey and white wavy lines.

Next, I need to *identify the distractors*. There are a few visible: in the first row, second column, there’s a red curtain with a white question mark – that's a hidden object. In the second row, second column, there's a five-pointed star with a thick black border and vertical grey and white stripes inside. There’s another hidden object in the third row, first column, another red curtain with a question mark. The rest of the cells are empty.

Now comes the crucial part: *formulating the description*. The objective is to make sure that the listener is able to pick out the object I want them to. I need to make sure my description *unambiguously* differentiates the target from the star, and from any hidden objects (I'm told the other person has this knowledge).

The obvious distinguishing feature is the *shape*: triangle versus star. That's a strong starting point. The triangle's *green border* is also a visual feature. I can also describe the internal pattern, which is a *wavy grey and white pattern* – that's different from the star’s stripes.

I also have to consider the fact that there are hidden objects. I'm told that the listener knows about the hidden objects. This means that I can't be too general. Simply saying ""the triangle"" isn't good enough, because there might be another triangle behind one of the curtains. I need to be *specific*. I'll try to describe all unique features.

Let's begin to combine features. “The object is a triangle with a green border and a wavy pattern inside.” This is likely robust enough.

Now, let's *refine* the description by comparing the target to the visible distractor (the star). The target is a triangle with a green border and wavy pattern. The star is a star with a black border and stripes. We can be sure that this unique combination of shape, border color, and internal pattern should sufficiently identify our target.

I also need to make sure my description avoids any use of spatial location, such as ""left"", ""middle"", or ""above"". The description should also be specific enough to distinguish the target object from potentially hidden objects.

The *final check* is to make sure the description is precise and concise. Is my description specific enough to distinguish it from the visible star? Yes. Is it specific enough to distinguish it from any hidden objects? Yes, by describing the combination of shape, border, and internal pattern.

So, I'm going to start with a good description that is the triangle with a green border and wavy pattern inside. I'm going to be very succinct, and I will be specific about each of the objects features. 

Therefore, I'll go with: **""The object is a triangle with a green border, filled with a wavy gray and white pattern.""** That's the most precise.

exp2_086.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,star,black,dot,"2,3",Select the star that has a black outline and is filled with grey polka dots.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to guide the other person to select the correct object from a grid, and I can't just point or name it directly. I need to use descriptions that are unambiguous and informative. This is a classic test of clarity and efficiency in communication, and as an expert in my field, I need to make this a concise, focused description.

First, I need to analyze the scene. I've got a 3x3 grid, some empty cells, some cells with visible objects, and a couple of mystery items hidden behind those red curtains with question marks. The target is highlighted, so I know where to focus.

I've identified the visible objects: a green star with a grey wavy pattern in the top-left, and the target object, a black-outlined star with a grey polka dot pattern inside, in the bottom-center. My first mental note is to contrast. I know the other visible star has a green outline and a wavy pattern. That will be critical for a precise description.

Now, let's dissect the target: It's a star, with a black outline and a grey polka dot pattern filling the interior. I need to select the most distinctive features for my description. A simple “star” isn't enough; it's the black outline and the polka dots that set it apart.

I've been mentally drafting possible descriptions: ""Select the star with the black outline and polka dots inside,"" ""It's a star filled with grey dots,"" or more contrastive options, ""There is a star with a black outline and another with a green outline. I want you to select the one with the black outline."" ""The star that has a polka dot pattern inside.""

I should combine key attributes. The black outline and polka dot pattern feel the most distinctive compared to the green star with a wavy pattern. I'm aiming for clarity and avoiding any ambiguity. The other person can see the hidden objects too, so I can provide enough detail to allow the listener to identify the object even if the hidden items are similar. I don't want to rely on the location (""the one on the bottom"").

""Select the star that has a black outline and is filled with grey polka dots."" That's a strong start. Let's simplify and make it as direct as possible, I think. ""Grey polka dots"" is technically accurate, but ""polka dots"" is likely sufficient.

So, I'm down to: ""The star with the black outline filled with polka dots."" ""The black-outlined star that's filled with grey dots."" ""Select the star with the black outline and the dotted pattern."" All of them are clear and concise.

I'm settling on the most direct and specific, ""The star with the black outline and the grey polka dot pattern inside."" It's specific, clear, and makes the correct visual distinctions. It is complete enough to allow the user to make the right selection, given the objects they can see. That should do the trick!

exp2_087.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,star,black,checker,"1,2",It's the star with the checkerboard pattern inside.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm in a reference game. The goal is to describe a specific object in an image so someone else can pick it out. I'm focusing on the image, and my thought process is all about effective communication.

First, I assessed the scene. It's a 3x3 grid with four objects present. I quickly noted the key details of each object: the triangle with a green border and wavy pattern, the striped star, the checkered star (that's my target), and the dotted square with a red border. The rest of the grid is empty, so it's not relevant.

My central task is clearly identifying the target, which is that black-bordered star with the checkerboard pattern inside.

Now, I'm thinking about how to distinguish it. Just saying ""the star"" won't cut it, there are two! I have to create a description that’s unambiguous, something that leaves no room for guessing. I'm focusing on the significant differences to formulate the optimal descriptor.

The other star, the one in the top middle, is the closest distractor. It has the same shape and border, so those features are useless here. The key difference is the internal pattern: checkerboard versus vertical stripes. The shape and the border color are irrelevant since they're the same in the target and a distractor. The other objects are different shapes and colors, so they don’t need careful descriptors to be distinguished. Spatial location isn't allowed, so that's out.

I considered a few options. I could say ""the star with the checkerboard pattern inside."" That's very direct. ""The checkered star"" is also concise and should work. I could even go negative: ""the star that is not striped,"" but positive descriptors are generally preferable if possible. I could also mention the specific colors of the checkerboard - grey and white, but this isn't strictly necessary.

Ultimately, I think the most effective description will be, ""The star with the checkerboard pattern"". It's clear, precise, and immediately differentiates the target from the most similar distractor. It leaves no room for confusion. That's my winning description.
"
exp2_088.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,"circle, circular",red,checker,"3,2",The circle filled with a checkerboard pattern.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so the task is to act as the speaker in a reference game. My goal is to clearly describe a target object so someone else can select it from a group of distractors. First, I ran through my mental checklist: I'm the speaker (check), but not the one selecting the target (check), and the arrangement of objects might be different for the listener (check). I have to avoid spatial descriptions (check), and the target is indicated (check). Alright, I'm at 5/5, so I am ready.

Let's dive in. I need to break this down. First, I analyze the target. It's a circle, red outline, and a grey and white checkerboard pattern filling the inside. Now, I need to analyze the distractors: top-left is a blue-outlined star with grey dots, top-right is a black-outlined triangle with a checkerboard pattern, bottom-left is a red-outlined star with a checkerboard pattern, and bottom-right is a blue-outlined square with a wavy line pattern. There are empty spots but I don't care about those.

Now, I start to formulate my description. My initial thought was ""the checkerboard circle."" Is that unique? Yes! There is only one circle in the set and two checkerboard pattern objects: the circle, the bottom-left star, and the triangle. ""The checkerboard circle"" distinguishes the target. What about ""The red circle""? Also unique. Two features, shape and color, define it clearly. ""The circle with a red outline and a checkerboard pattern""? That's precise, but is it overkill?

I need to compare options: ""The checkerboard circle"" uses pattern and shape. ""The red circle"" uses color and shape. ""The circle,"" alone, might be sufficient. Only one circle is present, so let's verify. Yes, only one. I think it is safe.

I'm starting to refine. Should I add extra detail? I will test it with different combinations of color and shape.

""The circle"" is concise and relies on the listener correctly identifying the shape. Let's look at the patterns: dots, checkerboard, and waves. Shapes: stars, a triangle, a circle, and a square. Outline colors: blue, black, and red.

""The circle"" - Strong candidate. Easy to understand and minimal. ""The object with a checkerboard pattern and a red outline."" That is also unique. However, that description is not unique on its own. It's too ambiguous.

Let's evaluate ""The checkerboard circle."" Shape: Circle. Only one. Pattern: Checkerboard. Three objects have this. Combining them gives ""The circle with a checkerboard pattern"". That is unique.

""The red circle"" works as well. It distinguishes this from the bottom-left star.

Which is the best? ""The circle"" is the simplest. But ""The circle with the checkerboard pattern"" is clearer. Let's imagine being the listener. They see the circle. Easy. They see the red circle. Easy. They see the checkerboard circle. Easy.

All three seem valid, but I am the speaker and want to be clear and concise. Is ""The circle"" too risky? The other shapes are distinct. ""The circle"" works well, but I will improve it.

What about combining features that are not unique on their own? The target has a red outline and a checkerboard pattern. The star in the bottom-left also does, so it's not enough on its own. The shape is key! I need to mention the shape. I need to make sure that the listener can distinguish between the star and the circle. The bottom-left star *also* has a checkerboard pattern and a red outline. I must mention the shape.

Since the shape ""circle"" is unique to the target object among all the objects shown, it is the most efficient and sufficient descriptor. ""The circle with the checkerboard pattern."" This is also unambiguous. It differentiates it from the triangle and star.

Let's review this against the constraints. I will also make it clear that it is filled with the checkerboard pattern. No spatial location: Check. Describes the target: Check. Distinguishes from distractors: Check. The bottom-left star is red and checkered. The top-right triangle is black and checkered. My target is the red circle that is checkered. So mentioning the shape is crucial. ""The circle filled with a checkerboard pattern"" works perfectly. The color of the outline might be a good addition but isn't strictly necessary since there's only one checkered circle.

Final decision: ""The circle filled with a checkerboard pattern."" It's concise, and perfectly unambiguous. Let's finalize it!

exp2_089.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,4,square,black,dot,"3,3",Select the square that has a grid of gray dots inside of it.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game, and my goal is to describe a specific object so someone else can pick it out from a set of options. I can see a 3x3 grid, but some cells are empty or covered by red curtains with question marks. Those hidden ones are out of my hands, but the listener knows them, which is something to keep in mind.

My target object is highlighted, and I need to avoid spatial references because the layout could be different for the listener. I see a blue star with a checkerboard pattern, a red star with stripes, and the highlighted object, which is a square with a black outline and a grid of grey dots inside.

My immediate thought is, ""Okay, it's a square with grey dots."" That seems simple enough to differentiate it from the stars. But I need to refine that description to ensure clarity and specificity, especially considering the unknown hidden objects. I considered things like color, shape, and pattern. I want to be concise but also precise.

I considered options like ""the square filled with a grid of grey dots"" which is better than ""square with gray dots."" I want to incorporate the black border in the description and also include the color of the dots. 

I then considered my final output, which I would like to be as clear as possible: ""The object is a square with a grid of gray dots inside."" This uses the essential information about its shape, the grid pattern, and color. It's concise, unambiguous given the constraints of what I can see, and emphasizes the distinguishing features. I am unable to know what the hidden items are, but assuming that they're dissimilar, then this should suffice. That's the best I can do with the information I have.
"
exp2_090.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,"triangle, triangular",green,dot,"3,2","It's a triangle with a green border, filled with grey dots.","**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is clear: describe the target object so someone else can identify it. They're shown an image, I'm not. The target is highlighted by a dashed red box. My mental process needs to be precise and efficient. Let's break this down:

First, I need to *analyze* the visual information. It's a 3x3 grid, a simple matrix. There are four patterns/objects visible. Two are hidden behind red curtains. The remaining two that are visible are key; one is a green circle filled with vertical grey stripes and the other is the target: a green triangle filled with grey dots. The rest of the grid squares are empty.

Next, I *identify* the target object precisely. It's the object inside the red dashed box. It's a triangle, a very specific geometric shape. Its outline is green, and that green encloses an interior filled with a pattern of grey dots.

Now, I need to consider *distractors*. The most prominent distractor is the green circle with the vertical grey stripes. However, I have to account for the unknown objects hidden behind the red curtains. That's the real challenge; I have no visual information about them. I need to assume they could be similar and thus I need a comprehensive description.

With this in mind, I need to *formulate the description* carefully. I cannot use spatial references. The description has to focus on its visual properties, avoiding ambiguity. The *shape* is a triangle, a strong starting point. The *color* of the outline is green, but that alone isn't enough as the circle is also green. Finally, the *internal pattern* is crucial: the triangle is filled with grey dots. The circle is filled with vertical grey stripes. That's the key distinguishing feature.

I'll start to *draft the description*. First attempt, ""It's the green triangle."" Too vague! What if there's another green triangle hidden? ""It's the shape filled with dots."" That’s better, but a dotted *what*? What if there's another dotted shape? The combination is best: ""It's the green triangle filled with grey dots."" That describes shape, color, and internal pattern all in one go!

Now, for the *refinement*. I want to make sure it's clear and concise. ""Select the green triangle with grey dots inside?"" That works. ""The object is a triangle with a green border, filled with grey dots."" Okay. ""It's the green-outlined triangle filled with dots."" All good but the most direct description is, ""The green triangle filled with grey dots."" It covers all the core visual features and contrasts it well with the green circle with the stripes. More importantly, it is likely to distinguish it from the unknown objects behind the curtains. I'm confident with that. It's as specific as I can be with the information I have.
"
exp2_091.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,square,black,"wavy, zigzag","2,1",It's the square with the black outline and a wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing a Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game. My task is to describe this target object – the one highlighted by the dashed red box – in a way that someone else can easily pick it out. The tricky part? I can't mention its location on the grid. I need to focus on its visual properties, so I'll start by breaking down all the features and then go from there.

First, let's analyze the target itself. I see a square shape, a black outline, a wavy line pattern, and a fill color that's a mix of grey and white. I am making sure not to mention the location – even though I know it's in the top row, middle column.

Then, I'll go through the other three objects (the distractors) to look for anything that’s similar or different:

*   Object 1: It's a triangle with a blue outline and a checkerboard pattern filled with grey and white.
*   Object 2: Another triangle, but this one has a green outline and the same checkerboard and fill colors as the other.
*   Object 3: A circle, green outline, a wavy pattern and a grey and white fill.

Now, I'm forming a description to be as unambiguous as possible. The goal is to uniquely identify the target. I can see a few good options:

*   ""It's a square"": This seems like a great start because there is only one square in the group.
*   ""It has a black outline"": This works well too, as there's only one object with that color border.
*   ""It's the object with a wavy pattern and a black outline.""
*   ""It's the square with the wavy pattern.""

Okay, let's compare my potential strategies and see which is best. I am thinking, for efficiency and clarity: ""It's the square."" This is the simplest and most effective. ""It has a black outline,"" is the next best. Both work really well, because there is only one square and one object with a black outline. Adding more detail, while correct, isn't necessary.

I'm considering potential ambiguities. Is the wavy line pattern truly ""wavy,"" or maybe more ""squiggly?"" The outline is definitely ""black,"" not ""dark grey."" And the shapes are clear: square, triangle, and circle.

My final choice of description is: ""The square."" I have thought it through, and it's the most direct and unambiguous.

However, I'm thinking about giving a longer description, just in case. The task *is* to speak, so perhaps a bit more clarity would be better.

""The square with the wavy pattern."" I am breaking this down: ""The square"" immediately narrows the choice down, and ""with the wavy pattern"" is to ensure accuracy.

Another option: ""The square with the black outline."" This is also very good. Again, the 'square' immediately narrows it, and the 'black outline' reinforces it.

I am weighing these, I know the target has multiple unique features. It looks like it is most unique in that it is a square, and it has a black outline. So, which is better? The pattern feels like a more complex feature than the outline color. I could describe the pattern as ""wavy"" and this seems straightforward. But, I am comparing the target to the other ones.

*   The circle has a wavy pattern, so that by itself isn't enough to uniquely identify.
*   No other object has a black outline, and this seems like a quick way to identify.

So, the simplest and clearest descriptions are ""the square"" and ""the object with the black outline."" Since this is a speaking exercise, the more features I can give the better, to ensure that the user can pick the target out. The square is crucial because it differentiates from the other shapes.

My most salient features are ""square"" and ""black outline"". So, I am going to combine the two for maximum clarity:

""It's the square with the black outline."" This is very solid.

I could have also said, ""It's the square with the wavy pattern."" That also would have worked.

I'm thinking if I should reverse this: ""Select the object with the wavy pattern that is a square."" or ""Of the two objects with a wavy pattern, select the square."" But this is more complicated.

My conclusion: Stick with the simplest and most direct description. There is only one square, so it is best to simply refer to its shape.

However, I could consider the full set of attributes to decide:

Target: shape: square, outline: black, pattern: wavy.

exp2_092.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,"triangle, triangular",red,dot,"1,3",The triangle with the red outline and dots inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to guide someone to select a specific object from a visual grid. I'm given the role of a speaker, and my goal is to provide a description of the target. I'll need to be accurate and efficient in my communication. I need to describe the image without referring to its spatial location.

First, I take a good look at the 3x3 grid. It contains four visible objects: a black-outlined checkerboard triangle in the top-right, a red-outlined star with grey dots in the middle-right, a green-outlined square with grey dots in the bottom-center, and finally, my target: a red-outlined triangle with grey dots inside in the bottom-left. There’s also a dashed red box around the target that I can see.

Next, I zero in on my target object. It's a triangle with a red border filled with grey dots. I note the presence of other objects: a similar triangle, a star, and a square.

Now, I start crafting my description. I'm focusing on the distinguishable features. To make sure my description stands out from others, I need to list the unique differences between my target and the other objects. The other triangle has a black outline. The star has the red outline but is a star shape, not a triangle. And the square has a green outline.

Okay, I need to devise some key distinctions. I can either use ""red outline"" or ""dotted fill"" to ensure the listener identifies the right triangle. But since the red outline is also shared by a star, ""triangle"" has to be included. I start composing sentences that work. ""The red triangle."" ""The dotted triangle."" ""The triangle with dots inside."" These all work. But I also notice the star and square, so I combine the properties with the shapes to give the final object the best chance of being selected.

I make sure the description works against all the other objects: the black-bordered triangle, the dotted star, and the dotted square.

I want my description to be concise and unambiguous. I also want to make sure it can be understood even if the other person is colorblind. Now I need to consider which properties are the *most* helpful. If I say ""The shape with a red outline and dots inside,"" it could refer to both the triangle and the star. I need to make the descriptions more concrete to be clear, so that means listing the shape itself, the color, and the pattern.

Okay, so the best descriptions I can come up with are either ""the red triangle"" or ""the dotted triangle"". Both uniquely identify the target object. I'll combine the descriptions for increased clarity. Let’s consider:

*   ""The red triangle with dots inside.""
*   ""The triangle with a red outline.""
*   ""The dotted triangle with a red outline.""
*   ""The triangle with a dotted pattern.""
*   ""The triangle with a red border that is filled with grey dots.""

My goal is to be super clear. I want a description that's not just accurate, but also efficient. I'm going with: ""The triangle with the red outline and dots inside.""

exp2_093.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,square,red,"wavy, zigzag","3,2",Select the square that has a gray and white wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object clearly enough that someone else can pick it out. Let's break this down.

First, I need to analyze the visual scene. I see a 3x3 grid, some empty spaces, and a few objects. There are two ""mystery"" cells behind red curtains, which I can't see but the listener can. There's a square with a black border filled with a grey dot grid. And then the target object: a square, highlighted by a red dashed box, with a red border, and a grey and white wavy line pattern inside.

My immediate task is identifying the key features of the target. Square shape. Red border. Wavy, horizontal gray and white line pattern. Now, I need to look at the other visible items – the polka-dot square is the obvious distractor. Black border, gray dots on white. I can't be sure about the two hidden objects, but I have to assume my description might match them accidentally.

Now for description formulation. I can’t use location – that’s a constraint. So, I have to focus on visual characteristics. My first thought is ""Select the square with the red border."" It's simple, but what if one of those hidden objects has a red border? I should really zero in on that distinctive pattern.

I compare the target and the visible distractor. Border color: Red vs. Black. That's a strong differentiator. Internal pattern: Wavy lines vs. Dots. Also, distinct. Though the colors of the patterns are similar (grey and white), the arrangement is completely different.

I consider the description: ""Select the square with the red border and the wavy pattern inside."" This is most robust and less likely to match a hidden object. I think that's the key. I could say ""Select the square with a wavy pattern"". But what if a hidden object also has a wavy pattern? I want to be as unambiguous as possible.

The ""red frame"" or ""red border"" would be a nice identifier, but the wavy gray pattern is more distinctive. I want a complete description for clarity: ""Select the square that has a wavy gray and white pattern inside."" Should I also include the border? I'm debating the level of detail to strike the best balance. The pattern *is* very distinct. Perhaps, ""Select the square with the wavy pattern."" This is short and sweet.

I need to focus on the unique elements. That wavy pattern is very different from the polka dots. Should I use both? That's safest, but maybe not necessary.

My concern is that other objects, out of sight, could have a wavy pattern. It's a risk. I want to be clear. Okay, let's include the border.

""The square with the wavy pattern."" would be my top choice. However, I want to be more specific. I think that's the best option. I believe I have it: **""Select the square with the wavy pattern.""**
"
exp2_094.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,star,green,dot,"1,3",Select the green star with dots inside.,"**Analyzing the Target and Distractors for Precise Identification**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with acting as a speaker in a reference game. My objective is clear: describe the highlighted object in the image, the ""target,"" in such a way that another person can identify it without ambiguity. I'm seeing a dashed red box around the object I need to describe.

First, I need to break down the features of the target object. It's a star, with a green outline and grey polka dots inside. Crucially, it's located in the bottom-left of a 3x3 grid, but I must avoid these spatial cues. The objective is for this person to be able to identify it even if the objects' spatial locations have been shuffled.

Next, I look at the distractors, the other objects in the grid: a green, striped circle; a black, striped triangle; a red, striped star; and a red, dotted circle. Now comes the important bit: formulating a description that uniquely identifies the target, avoiding any potential ambiguity.

I'm thinking: just saying ""the star"" isn't enough, as there's another star in the grid. ""The green object"" isn't sufficient either, as there's a green circle. Even ""the dotted object"" could cause confusion, as the red circle also has dots.

I can combine these features. ""The green star"" works. The other star is red, the green object is a circle. ""The star with dots"" will also work, given that the other star has stripes and the other dotted object is a circle. ""The green object with dots"" is also a good candidate, as the other green object is striped.

I need to keep in mind the constraints. I must avoid spatial locations. I have to assume the listener can see all objects. Now, I'm going to start with a direct description, but need to make it as concise as possible.

""The green star"" is clear. I'm checking for ambiguities. There is no other green star. ""The star with dots"" also works. The other star has stripes, and the other dotted object is a circle.

To maximize clarity, I could combine them: ""The green star with dots inside."" But let's check for the most efficient description possible.

I consider breaking down the description based on the other objects: ""There are two stars. Pick the one that's green."" It works. ""There are two stars. Pick the one with dots."" Also works. ""There are two green objects. Pick the one that's a star."" That will work. ""There are two dotted objects. Pick the one that's a star."" Also a viable option.

So I need to choose the most efficient description:

""The green star"" is the most direct and also works.
""The dotted star"" is also efficient and unambiguous.

To make the description foolproof, I would pick a description that uses multiple features. ""The green star that has dots inside,"" feels natural and covers the key elements.

""It's a star with a green outline and grey dots inside."" This is a bit too long.
""The green star with dots."" Good and concise.
""The dotted green star."" Another option.

Let's go with, ""The green star that has dots inside."" It's simple, clear, and makes it easy to communicate with another person.
"
exp2_095.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,"circle, circular",blue,dot,"1,3",The object with dots inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the goal is to describe a specific object in an image so that someone else can identify it in a reference game. I need to be as clear and unambiguous as possible. Let's break this down.

First, I need to analyze the image. It's a 3x3 grid with three objects. I see a square with a green border, a triangle with a blue border, and a circle with a blue border, which is the target. The internal patterns are the key here. The square and the triangle both have checkerboard patterns. The target circle has a pattern of grey dots on a white background.

Now, I'm identifying the unique features of the target: it's a circle and it has a dotted pattern. The blue border is shared, so while relevant, it's less defining. I'm instructed to avoid overly specific spatial locations.

I'm thinking about how to phrase my description. Simple is good, but precise is better. ""The circle"" might work if there's only one. Is that true? Yes! Great. But what if the person isn't seeing the same arrangement? I need to be safe. ""The dotted object"" also singles out the target object uniquely. No other object has this pattern.

Combining the features feels strongest. ""The circle with the dotted pattern"" is very specific. I could also say ""The object that is a circle and has a dotted pattern inside,"" just to be maximally precise. I need to make sure I consider possible ambiguities and edge cases. What about ""The blue-bordered circle with a dotted pattern inside""? The border is shared but it's part of the complete object.

For brevity, I need to refine further. Considering the distractors – the triangle and the square – I can see they share the ""checkerboard"" pattern. This makes ""The object with dots inside"" a particularly good choice. I'm focusing on the *contrast* this creates with the other objects in the context.

I've considered several options: ""The circle with dots inside,"" ""The dotted circle,"" ""The object with a dotted pattern,"" and so on. But ""The object with dots inside"" is concise, unambiguous, and effectively highlights the key distinguishing feature. That's the best option here.
"
exp2_096.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,star,green,dot,"1,3",The star with the green outline and dots inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game and need to describe the highlighted target object so someone else can pick it out. My job is to be as clear and precise as possible. It's a five-pointed star with a green outline and filled with grey dots. I've got to make sure my description allows the listener to pick *this* star and *only* this star from the other options.

First, I assessed the scene. There's a blue star with grey dots, a wavy black circle, a wavy red triangle, and two hidden objects. The blue star is the immediate threat – it's practically identical, just a different outline color. I need to nail down that color difference.

My first thought was, ""The star with the green outline and grey dots inside"" seems pretty solid. But, is it too verbose? I need to consider all possibilities, including the hidden objects. Are there any potential ambiguities? Is it possible the hidden objects could also be green stars with gray dots? It seems unlikely in a well-constructed game but it’s always wise to assume the game designer might be trying to trick you. I need to make sure my description uniquely identifies the target.

I considered: ""The green star with dots inside."" This is more concise, and ""green"" is the unique visual differentiator among the available options. It distinguishes from the other shapes and the blue star. Is it sufficient if there are other objects hidden? Yes, the target’s attributes distinguish it from the objects that are available.

Let's break down the attributes. The shape is a star, but so is one other object, so I’m going to include that in my description. The color is green, which is unique among the visible objects. And the pattern is dots, which is also shared by one other object. Since the color is unique, I *could* just say “the green object”, but what if a hidden object is also green? That is too risky. It’s better to be specific. Since there are other stars, I need to mention the shape, so they are not confused with the circle and the triangle. The ""dots"" are important, too, for robustness.

So, I’m leaning towards ""The green star with dots inside."" That should do the trick. It uses all the salient features, while also being relatively concise. The phrase *the green star* should be enough to differentiate the target from the blue star. The *dots* won't hurt, and may help if the hidden objects are tricky. The overall description is robust and clear.

exp2_097.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,square,black,stripe,"3,2",It's the square with vertical grey and white stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game and need to describe this target object for the listener to correctly identify it. My process is pretty straightforward. First, I need to analyze the visual information, and then craft the best description.

I'm looking at a 3x3 grid. Some cells are empty, some have a red curtain (indicating a hidden object), and some contain visible objects. I can see a red-outlined star with vertical grey and white stripes, a blue-outlined star with a dotted pattern, and a black-bordered square filled with vertical grey and white stripes. The object I need to describe is the last one: the black-bordered square with the vertical stripes. It's important to remember that the listener *cannot* see the hidden objects; my description must be unambiguous regardless of what's behind those curtains.

Now, what makes this object unique? Well, it's a *square*, which immediately sets it apart from the stars. It also has a *black* border, which distinguishes it from the red and blue stars. And of course, the fill pattern is *vertical grey and white stripes*. I need to choose my words carefully, avoiding spatial references, in case a hidden object shares one or more of these properties. I have to think about what makes the target square *the only one identifiable* among all possibilities.

I’m thinking about what could make the listener immediately identify this specific object. Is ""the square with vertical stripes"" sufficient? Considering the other visible objects, that should work, as the others are stars. ""The object with a black border"" is also a good descriptor. Combining ""the square with a black border"" with ""vertical grey and white stripes"" gives me a very specific and robust description. It feels like combining the shape and the pattern would be best, to make the description unambiguous.

I need to make sure I'm not just relying on one distinguishing feature, in case a hidden object shares it. So I need to combine multiple features. Considering the grid, ""The square with vertical stripes"" is strong. It's the only visible square. Then I thought about adding the border, as in ""the square with a black border, filled with vertical stripes."" But this feels too long.

So let’s check the characteristics. The shape (square) and the pattern (vertical stripes) seem to be the most salient and unique. ""It's the square with vertical stripes"" seems strong. The listener would know that it is a square, and the shape itself is enough to distinguish it from the other objects. The listener can see the complete grid, and would see any square that is visible. So the description ""the square"" should be enough. Then I considered the border, the vertical pattern that the target object shares with the red star, and that combining both characteristics (square and stripes) might be more robust and clearer to understand.

Therefore, the best way to be robust is to combine the shape, border, and the pattern. The target is the only square. It also one of two objects with vertical stripes. I’ll make sure my response should be clear and easily understood by the user.

Therefore I should respond with: ""The square with vertical stripes.""

exp2_098.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,square,blue,stripe,"1,2",The object is a square with vertical stripes inside and a blue border.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I need to describe a specific object in a grid so someone else can identify it. This is essentially a reference game, and I need to be precise. Let's break this down systematically.

First, I'm analyzing what I see in the dashed red box. It's a square. The border is blue, and the inside has a pattern of vertical gray and white stripes. I've noted the specifics.

Next, I need to look at what else is in the grid. There are two stars – one with a black border and wavy stripes and the other with a blue border and a checkerboard pattern. The rest of the grid is empty. I'm focusing on the distractors to pinpoint what makes my target unique.

So, here's my strategy: I'll identify the unique features of the target object. It's a square, and the other objects are stars, that's a pretty significant distinction right there. Then, I notice the vertical stripes, a distinct pattern compared to the wavy lines and the checkerboard pattern. The blue border is a factor, but one of the stars shares the same border color, so I'll need to use that feature in combination.

I'm thinking of how to describe the object. Focusing on the most unique features is the key here. Describing the shape first is probably the most direct approach. ""The object is a square,"" boom, eliminates the stars right away. I can also mention the pattern, ""The object has vertical stripes."" This is also very specific. Combining them gives me a more robust description.

I'm refining my description. ""The square with vertical stripes"" is clear and concise. I'm consciously avoiding any location-based descriptions, because I don't know the exact arrangement of the objects on the other person's screen. I also need to be certain to *not* include any references to the red dashed box as that is only a visual marker for me. It's about being simple and unambiguous.

Now, final description choices. ""The object is the square with vertical stripes"" is very specific and accurate. A simpler option: ""The square with vertical stripes."" I could even go with something very direct like, ""The object that is a square"". I'm considering that since it is the only square, that might be sufficient.

I want to make sure the other person can identify the object with confidence. For maximum clarity, combining the shape and pattern seems best.

""The object is a square with vertical stripes inside and a blue border,"" is accurate. Then, I am trying to make it a bit more natural, such as, ""Select the square that has vertical stripes."" ""There's a square with a blue border and vertical gray and white stripes inside.""

Given the simple scene, just pointing out the shape might be enough. ""The object is the square."" To be extra safe, let's include the pattern. ""The square with the vertical stripes."" This seems clear, concise, and should absolutely distinguish the target.

exp2_099.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,"circle, circular",green,"wavy, zigzag","2,3",Select the circle with the wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Navigating the Reference Game**

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game. The goal is to describe a target object in an image so that someone else can identify it. Here's how I'm approaching this, step-by-step, because it requires precision and no ambiguity:

First, I see a 3x3 grid with four visible objects. I quickly analyze each object: top-left is a green-bordered square with a wavy gray pattern; top-center is a blue-bordered circle with vertical gray stripes; middle-left is a red-bordered star with vertical gray stripes; and the bottom-center object, the target, is a green-bordered circle with a wavy gray pattern. The rest of the grid is empty.

Now, I've identified the target. It’s a green-bordered circle with a wavy gray pattern. The challenge, of course, isn't just *what* it is, but *how* to describe it uniquely. So, I need to consider all the distractors – the other objects in the image.

I systematically compare the target to each distractor. The square has a green border and a wavy pattern, but it's a square. The other circle is a circle, but it has a blue border and striped pattern. The star is clearly different on multiple levels.

My initial thought is to simply call it ""a circle"". Nope. The presence of another circle negates that. ""It has a green border""? The square also has a green border. ""It has a wavy pattern inside?"" Again, the square. This reveals I need to *combine* features for a unique description.

So, I start combining. ""The circle with the green border"". Bingo! The other circle is blue. ""The circle with the wavy pattern""? Works as well; the other circle is striped. ""The green object that's a circle""? Good, the other green object is a square. ""The wavy-patterned object that's a circle?"" Also good!

I’m refining descriptions. I want something concise and clear. ""Select the circle that has a wavy pattern inside"" is technically correct but maybe a little verbose. ""The green circle"" is short, but it's *safe* in that there's no way anyone could confuse it. Let's think about this systematically. Shape, color, pattern. Combining *any two* of these should give me a unique descriptor, right? Let's check:

*   Shape + Color: ""The green circle"" – perfect.
*   Shape + Pattern: ""The circle with the wavy pattern"" – also great.
*   Color + Pattern: ""The green object with the wavy pattern""... wait, this is ambiguous. The green square *also* has a wavy pattern. Okay, lesson learned: Always include the shape when combining these features.

So, I’ve re-evaluated ""Color + Pattern."" Now, given the shape is a circle, I know ""the green object with the wavy pattern"" is unique.

I'm checking all combinations. ""The green circle"", ""the circle with the wavy pattern."" I could go for maximum clarity with something like, ""The circle with a green border and a wavy gray pattern inside,"" but that's a bit redundant. I want to keep it succinct while maintaining uniqueness.

Final check! ""The green circle"" works. ""The circle with the wavy pattern"" also works. I have to contrast it with the other circle (striped pattern) and the other wavy-patterned object (square shape). Therefore, ""The circle with the wavy pattern inside."" seems like the best choice, it mentions two features for uniqueness.

exp2_100.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,square,green,dot,"3,2",The object inside the green border that has a pattern of grey dots.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to help the listener identify the target object. I need to be precise, but also efficient in my description. Let me break down my thought process:

First, I've taken a good look at the image. It's a 3x3 grid. I'm focusing on the visible elements. There's a checkerboard pattern, the target object (the one with the dashed red box around it), and two red curtains hiding other objects. The target is an array of grey dots on a white background, all inside a solid green border.

My challenge here is to create a description that uniquely identifies the target, even though there might be hidden objects. I need a description that would work regardless of what's behind those curtains.

To do this, I'm identifying key features. The green border is a shared element. The most immediately distinct feature is the pattern *inside* that border: a grid of dots. Now, comparing the target to what is *visible*, the checkerboard pattern has a solid green border, like the target. My description has to focus on what differentiates these two.

So, here's my plan: I'm going to describe the target's distinctive visual features: the green border and the pattern of grey dots. I'll make sure to contrast it with the checkerboard pattern. I considered, but rejected, relying on any spatial cues. I also acknowledged the possible hidden objects, and I'm aware that my strategy has to be as descriptive as possible.

Here's my final description: **""The square with a green border that contains a grid of grey dots.""** I think this is clear and concise, and I hope it works.
"
exp2_101.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,"circle, circular",green,checker,"3,3",The circle with the checkerboard pattern.,"**My Thought Process: Selecting the Target Object**

Okay, here's how I'm thinking through this reference game. My goal is to describe the target object (the one with the red dashed box) so the other person can identify it. They'll have a different view of the setup, so I need to be as precise as possible, based only on what I can see.

First, I analyze the image itself. I've got a 3x3 grid, some empty squares, some squares with objects, and some hidden behind question mark-covered curtains. The visible objects are two circles with green outlines. One has vertical grey and white stripes inside, and the target object has a grey and white checkerboard pattern.

My immediate focus is on the distinguishing features of the target. It's a circle, it has a green outline (this feature is also shared with another object, so isn't the primary identifier), and, crucially, it has a checkerboard pattern inside, specifically grey and white squares.

Now, I look at the other visible objects to identify distractors. There is a second circle with a green outline but a striped pattern. I can't know what's hidden behind the curtains, so I need to be careful. The key is that the other person knows what is behind the curtain, so I need to provide the most specific description about visible objects, as hidden objects can be anything.

I need to formulate a description that will unambiguously identify the target. ""Checkerboard"" or ""checkered"" are clear and unambiguous terms. I'll consider how to phrase the descriptions. Starting with the most unique feature is often the best. It is important to emphasize the feature which makes this object different.

The initial thought is ""a circle with a green outline and a checkerboard pattern inside"", and this might be refined by considering other factors. Then I consider if ""checkerboard pattern"" is specific enough (yes, it is a standard term). I also note the need to specify ""circle"" to rule out other shapes that might have a checkerboard pattern. 

Given the uncertainty of the hidden objects, it's safer to be more descriptive. So, I consider different phrasings. I want something concise but clear. ""The circle with the checkered pattern"" is simple. I can make it even clearer: ""The circle with the gray and white checkered pattern.""

I then consider a conversational approach: ""There's a circle with stripes and a circle with a checkerboard pattern. Please select the one with the checkerboard pattern."" I then consider a direct instruction: ""Select the circle filled with a checkerboard pattern."" This seems sufficient and clear.

I will also do a final check. I want the description to not rely on spatial location, which may differ for the other person. I need to make sure the description is clear and unambiguous, given what I can see. So, I will use the most direct and descriptive phrase, but also consider whether to provide more details. I initially consider ""The circle with the checkerboard pattern,"" ""The circle with a green outline and a checkerboard pattern,"" and ""The object with a checkered pattern.""

Ultimately, I've decided on ""The circle with the checkerboard pattern."" This is concise and directly highlights the feature that distinguishes the target from the other visible object.
"
exp2_102.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,square,black,checker,"3,1",The object is a square with a checkerboard pattern and a black outline.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, here's how I'm thinking through this reference game. My primary goal is to provide a description that unambiguously identifies the target object. I'm being presented with a visual grid, and the user is an expert, so I need to be precise, concise, and avoid any ambiguity. I should assume they see the same items as I do.

First, I need to analyze the target. It's highlighted within a dashed red box. It's a square with a black outline and a checkerboard pattern inside.

Next, I need to look at the distractors – the other objects in the grid: there's a blue-outlined triangle with a checkerboard pattern, a red-outlined triangle with a wavy pattern, a blue-outlined circle with a wavy pattern, and a green-outlined triangle with a checkerboard pattern. There are also empty cells, but I can see all the objects.

Now, I'm forming my description. I need to single out the target uniquely. The shape is the most immediately obvious distinction: it's a square, and there are *no other squares* in the grid. This is a very strong and unique feature. However, I can't just stop there. The pattern is also a characteristic. But the checkerboard pattern is also present in two of the other objects (the blue and green triangles). The black outline is also a defining feature.

Now, I am combining these features: I could say, ""the square with the checkerboard pattern"", but since there is one other object with this pattern, I should be more specific, so ""the object that is a square and has a checkerboard pattern and a black outline"". This is robust, and unambiguous.

I should follow the instructions, which state I shouldn't use ""degenerate spatial locations"" (so, no ""top left"" etc.), and that some items might be hidden, though I can see everything in the grid. So I will focus my description on what I see.

After considering all this, I've decided the best description focuses on the unique features. ""The square"" is extremely concise, but might not be robust enough. So ""The object that is a square and has a checkerboard pattern and a black outline."" is a comprehensive description. The shape is the most unique.
"
exp2_103.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,square,red,dot,"2,1",It's the square that is filled with gray dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with acting as a speaker in a reference game. My objective is clear: describe this target object so someone else can identify it without ambiguity. I need to be as precise as possible.

First, let's break down what I see. It's a 3x3 grid, and I can see some objects in it, some covered by curtains. The target is highlighted, so I know which one to describe. It's in the top row, second column. It's a square. Inside the square is a grid of grey dots on a light grey background. Hmm, simple enough.

Now, let's identify what else is visible. To the left, there's a curtain. I can't describe what's behind it, so I should ignore that. To the right, there's a circle with a thick black border. Inside the circle, also a grid of grey dots on a light grey background. Down below is another curtain. Okay, so I need to distinguish the target (the square) from this circle, and the curtains are irrelevant.

What are the key features of the target? It's a square. It has a red border, and it's filled with grey dots. I must be careful not to rely on spatial location because the arrangement could change for the listener.

I start formulating descriptions. ""It's the square with dots inside"" is a decent starting point. However, that doesn't distinguish the dots in the circle. Okay, ""It's a square with a red border and grey dots inside."" Ah, the border color! That's a strong differentiator. The circle has a black border. I could just say ""Select the square with the red border"" or ""It's the square filled with grey dots.""

Let's compare them again. Target: Square shape, red border, grey dots. Distractor: Circle shape, black border, grey dots. It all hinges on the shape and border color. Mentioning both would be most robust. I could also say ""Select the square with the red border and grey dots inside."" But maybe that's too much?

I'm aiming for concise, yet unambiguous. From the listener's perspective, they'll see the square, the circle, and the curtains. If I say ""the square,"" they'll find it. If I say ""the object with a red border"", they'll find it. If I say ""the square with dots,"" they'll find it.

So, let me focus on the key differentiator. ""It's the square filled with grey dots."" This description is simple, direct, and effectively contrasts with the circle, because the circle has grey dots. Alternatively ""It's the square with the red border."" This is equally effective, and uses a very distinct feature of the target. I could even combine the description and say, ""It's the square with a red border and grey dots inside"", but that feels like unnecessary verbosity. The simplest should do the job.
"
exp2_104.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,2,"circle, circular",green,stripe,"2,3",The circle with the vertical stripes inside.,"**My Thought Process: Deciphering the Target**

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game again. The goal is to describe a specific object in an image so someone else can identify it. It's like a mental puzzle! Let's break it down:

First, I need to *really* analyze the scene. I see a 3x3 grid with three objects. The target is one of the bottom row circles. It's in the middle, and there's a red dashed box around it, a clear indicator. My focus has to be on making the listener understand which one the target is.

My mind immediately starts cataloging the details. The target object is a green-bordered circle with grey vertical stripes inside. Then I note the other objects: another green-bordered circle with a wavy grey pattern, and a black-bordered star, also with grey vertical stripes. Time to identify what makes my target unique.

Now I have to pick out the relevant features. The other objects are *distractors*, and I need to figure out how to separate the target from the others. I can't depend on location because the speaker might see them in a different arrangement. I can use color and shape and internal patterns. I'm going to formulate a description.

I'm thinking, ""Okay, let's start with the most obvious feature."" I'll say ""It's a circle."" That's the most basic shape. Boom, that takes the star out of the running. Now, how do I differentiate between the two circles? Both have a green border, so that's out. It's the internal pattern! One has wavy lines, the other has vertical stripes.

So I think, ""Let's say 'It's the circle with vertical stripes inside.'"" That should be enough to differentiate the target.

I'm double-checking. Does that description uniquely pinpoint the target? I'm reviewing it, making sure it holds up. There's a star with vertical stripes, but it's not a circle, so the description works. There's also another circle, but it has wavy lines, not vertical ones. The description is precise, it doesn't rely on the order of objects, and it should be concise and clear.

It's efficient. This description should work: ""The circle with vertical stripes."" Or perhaps ""The green circle with vertical stripes."" Or ""The circle that has gray and white vertical stripes inside."" Each one is good. But ""The circle with vertical stripes"" is simple and gets the information across. I'm going with that.
"
exp2_105.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,"triangle, triangular",black,dot,"2,1",The triangle filled with dots.,"**My Thought Process for Describing the Target**

Okay, here's the situation. I need to describe an object so someone else can identify it, a classic reference game. The target object is a triangle inside a dashed red box. My mission is to give enough information so the other person knows which one I am referencing.

First, let's break down the target: it's a triangle with a thick, black outline. Inside, it's filled with a pattern of grey dots, a polka-dot style. It's sitting in the top row, second column of a 3x3 grid, but I should avoid location references if possible.

Now, let's look at the context. There's another triangle directly to the left. That one also has a thick, black outline, but its fill pattern is vertical grey stripes, which is good. There's a red curtain with two white question marks covering two of the cells, so those are unknown, which I have to keep in mind. The other cells are empty, white.

I need to craft a description that uniquely identifies the target. The key distinguishing feature here is definitely the fill pattern. That's what separates it from the other visible triangle. I shouldn't rely on location terms because the objects might be rearranged for the other person. A basic description could be ""The triangle filled with dots,"" or I could go a bit more detailed like, ""The triangle with a thick black outline that is filled with grey dots."" The idea is to make the description robust against potentially unseen changes.

I need to consider what's behind the curtain. There could be other triangles, and other shapes, and I don't know the exact nature of those objects. To be safe, I need to be as specific as possible. If there's another triangle with dots behind the curtain, my simple description won't work, which means I've done a poor job, so this needs to be kept in mind.

My final descriptions are going to include the use of: ""The triangle with dots inside,"" ""The dotted triangle,"" and ""It's a triangle with a black outline and it's filled with dots"".

Given what I have, ""The triangle filled with dots"" is clear and concise, and focuses on the most easily discernible distinction. This should do the trick. That differentiates it from the only other visible object, ""the triangle filled with stripes."" Seems like the best choice, given that the most important distinguishing feature is the fill pattern.
"
exp2_106.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,"triangle, triangular",green,dot,"2,1",It's the triangle with the green outline that is filled with gray dots.,"**My Thought Process in Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the object in that dashed red box so someone else can identify it. Here's how I'm approaching this, step-by-step:

First, I need to *really* look at the target object. It's in the top row, the middle one. It's a triangle. The outline is green, and inside, it's filled with a pattern of gray dots on a white background. I need to remember that I can't mention the red box itself—that's only visible to me.

Next, I need to consider the other objects. Top left is a square, blue outline, same gray-dot pattern inside. Top right is a triangle, green outline (same color as mine!), but it has a gray and white checkerboard pattern. The bottom row is behind a red curtain with question marks (totally unknown variables there!), and the middle row is empty.

Now, let's formulate the description. It has to distinguish the target from the other visible items. The triangle shape helps distinguish it from the square on the left, which has a blue outline. I'm noting that the green outline is something to think about, since it's the same color as the other triangle. The gray dot pattern is what distinguishes it from the checkerboard triangle on the right.

So, initial descriptions are popping into my head: ""It's a triangle."" Too generic. ""It's the triangle with dots inside."" Better! It removes the checkerboard, but what about the blue square? Okay, refining: ""It's a green triangle with gray dots inside."" More specific. ""It's the shape with a green outline and a pattern of gray dots inside."" Good, but maybe too wordy?

Time to compare and contrast! The target versus the square: It's a triangle, not a square. Different shape, different outline color. The pattern is the same, so not useful here. Now versus the *other* triangle: The *pattern* is the key difference! It has dots; the other is a checkerboard. Both are the same outline color.

Let's refine: ""The object is a triangle with a green outline, and it is filled with gray dots."" Okay, clear but maybe a bit long? Shorter: ""The green triangle filled with gray dots."" That's good. But focusing on the most *unique* feature: ""It's the triangle with dots inside."" That's the most efficient. It clearly eliminates the other objects, no additional details needed.

Finally, I need to think about the unknown. What's *behind* that curtain? I have no idea. My description needs to be robust, regardless. For example, if there's *another* green triangle with dots, my description would be ambiguous. However, I can only describe what I can see. So, I will be as specific as possible: ""The green-outlined triangle filled with a pattern of gray dots."" is the best choice. It covers all the details. I will go with that!
"
exp2_107.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,"triangle, triangular",red,"wavy, zigzag","3,3",The object is a triangle with a red outline and a wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object within this grid so that someone else can correctly identify it. I need to be precise, unambiguous, and avoid using any forbidden spatial references. Let me break this down systematically.

First, I see a 3x3 grid. The target object is in the bottom-right cell, highlighted by that red box. I should analyze all the visible objects to make sure my description will work.

The target itself is a triangle. The outline is red, and the inside has a wavy grey and white pattern. I need to see what's special about this object.

Next, I need to see if any distractor objects share features:
*   **Top-left:** A star with a green outline and a grey/white wavy line pattern inside.
*   **Top-right:** A circle with a green outline and a grey polka dot pattern inside.
*   **Middle-left:** A square with a red outline and a grey/white checkerboard pattern inside.
*   **Middle-right:** A star with a green outline and a grey/white vertical stripe pattern inside.

I need to analyze all of these. I need to figure out what differentiates the target object from these distractors.

Now, let's analyze features and combinations: Shape, color and pattern.

-   The **shape**: It's a triangle. There's only one triangle visible. This is a very strong differentiator.
-   The **color:** It has a red outline. But the square in the middle-left also has a red outline, so this feature alone isn't unique.
-   The **pattern:** It has a wavy grey and white pattern inside. The star in the top-left also has a wavy pattern, so this alone isn't unique either.

I need to combine these features to create a unique description. Let's start with the simplest option and add complexity if needed.

""The triangle"" - Is that enough? Yes, it's the only triangle. The shape is the most immediately useful attribute.
""The red triangle with the wavy line pattern"" - This is also very accurate. This description would be the most difficult to misinterpret.
""The object with the red outline and wavy pattern"" - This would differentiate it from all the others.

The instructions say to not use degenerate spatial locations. I must not use ""bottom right,"" so I am avoiding that.

Let's start with the shape, since it's the only one of its kind. So, ""The triangle"". Is that enough? Probably. Let's be sure. What if another shape is hidden?

""The red triangle"" - Unique, and clear.
""The triangle with a wavy pattern"" - Also unique, and clear.

I am feeling confident. I will be sure to be as clear as possible.

""Select the triangle. It has a red border and a wavy pattern inside.""

I could also be more conversational: ""You're looking for the triangle. It's the one with the red border and the wavy pattern inside.""

I should summarize:
- **Target:** Shape=Triangle, Outline=Red, Pattern=Wavy
- Distractor 1: Shape=Star, Outline=Green, Pattern=Wavy
- Distractor 2: Shape=Circle, Outline=Green, Pattern=Polka Dot
- Distractor 3: Shape=Square, Outline=Red, Pattern=Checkerboard
- Distractor 4: Shape=Star, Outline=Green, Pattern=Stripes

I can see that the shape ""triangle"" is unique, and I need to start with that.

Therefore, the most efficient and unambiguous way to refer to the target is by its shape.

""It's the triangle.""

Or slightly more descriptive, in case there are hidden objects:

""Select the triangle with the wavy pattern."" This differentiates it from any potential other triangles that might be hidden and also from the other wavy object (the star).
""Select the red triangle."" This differentiates it from any potential other triangles and from the other red object (the square).

These seem good, but I will make the most clear statement.

""The target is the triangle. It has a red outline and is filled with a wavy pattern.""

Okay, I think that is perfect.

Okay, the goal is to describe this object so someone else can pick it out. I've got a mental 3x3 grid, and the target is in the bottom-left corner. Let's break this down systematically. First, I need to really *analyze* the target. It's a square. The border is red. Inside, there's a grey wavy line pattern. That's the core.

Next, I have to consider the *other* objects – the distractors. Top row, left, there's a red curtain with a question mark. Useless for now, but I have to remember that whatever is behind the curtain could drastically alter things. The middle and right on the top row are blank. The middle row has the blue bordered circle with the wavy pattern, which is interesting since it is the same pattern. Also, on the middle row on the right is the red bordered circle with stripes and, the bottom row, middle, the red bordered circle with polka dots. There's also another red curtain. These are the objects I have to distinguish the target from.

So, I need to come up with a description that's unique.  It's a **square**. That's key. All the other patterned objects are circles. The wavy line pattern, that's shared with one other object. The red border, that's shared with two others. Okay, so I could say, ""A square with a wavy line pattern."" That seems pretty good, right? Or ""an object with a red border and a wavy line pattern"" might also work. Or, ""a square with a red border"".

But what about those hidden objects?  There could be another square. Another object with wavy lines. Another red border. Another square with a wavy line pattern?  *That* is the critical factor. I need to make sure the description is robust *even if* something is hidden.

The most salient feature of all the other visible objects, is its shape. Shape is the most powerful discriminator among the visible objects. ""It's a square.""  Hmm... is that enough?  Probably not, given those curtains.  ""It's a square with a wavy line pattern.""  That's more specific. But can I do better? Adding the border color, ""It's a square with a red border and a wavy line pattern inside,"" might be the most complete.

Okay, let's compare my options. ""The square object."" Simple, but weak if there's another square hidden. ""The object with the wavy pattern and a red border."" This is a solid contender. ""The square with the wavy pattern."" That combines the shape and pattern. The shape is the powerful discriminator.

""The square with the wavy pattern."" That seems the most direct and least ambiguous description. I should check again for confusion. So I need to make the description *absolutely* bullet-proof, even with the hidden items in mind. I need to assume the worst: *another* square. Now I am thinking ""The square with the wavy line pattern inside.""

I should try to be concise. ""The square with the wavy pattern."" That is short, but still clear. The other wavy pattern is a circle with a blue border. So, this uniquely identifies the target, at least among the visible objects. If there is an identical object hidden, there is no way around this. So, let's test this description. The object is a square. It has a wavy pattern. Does it matter that it also has a red border? No. Is there any other square? Not visibly. So, I will proceed with ""The square with the wavy pattern.""

""The square with the wavy pattern"" is *sufficient* and *accurate*. I can trust this description. It concisely communicates the key distinguishing features. The description should allow the user to immediately identify the target. I'll stick with that.

exp2_109.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,"triangle, triangular",red,dot,"3,3",It's the triangle with a red outline that is filled with grey polka dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing a Target Object in a Reference Game**

Okay, so I'm being asked to describe a target object in a visual game. My initial goal is to accurately identify the target and create an unambiguous description. I'm given an image of a 3x3 grid, but some cells are hidden behind a curtain. The target, a triangle, is in the bottom right cell, clearly marked with a red outline and filled with grey polka dots. My task is to communicate the target’s identity to another person without relying on absolute spatial references, as the image might be different for them.

First, I mentally analyze the image. I note the visible items: the target triangle, and another object, a five-pointed star. This star is distinct, with a black outline and also filled with grey polka dots, as is the triangle. The curtain conceals the content of two cells.

I need a description that differentiates the target from the star, and hopefully from whatever might be under the curtain. I will focus on a few key characteristics: shape, outline color, and fill pattern. The triangle has a red outline, while the star has a black outline. Both are filled with the same polka dot pattern. Shape, therefore, is an important feature as well.

I begin formulating a description. I consider multiple options: ""It's the triangle"", is a solid start. The ""red outline"" is a critical feature to distinguish the target from the black-outlined star. So, ""the object with the red outline"" is good. The grey polka dot pattern is shared, but I should probably mention it for clarity: ""the polka-dotted object with a red outline"".

Let’s refine this. First, I want to use a direct approach. The most unique and immediately noticeable feature is the outline color. Therefore, I can begin with, ""The object with the red outline..."" however, it is likely better to offer more information. I am working with the premise that there could be other shapes to describe, and that there are currently objects hidden from view.
The object’s shape offers some protection against ambiguity: ""It's the triangle with the red outline,"" is concise and precise, it immediately isolates the target from the star, which is a star and not a triangle. The grey fill also makes it clear in the description: ""It’s a triangle with a red outline, and is filled with grey polka dots."" That seems pretty clear.

I will also do a quick check to see if my description uses absolute spatial locations, like ""the one on the right"", or ""the bottom row"". No, the goal is to make a description that can be used on any presentation of this image to accurately isolate the target object. It needs to be clear, precise, and not assume anything about the other person's view.

To be sure, I will consider a direct description, such as: ""It's a triangle with a red outline."" That is a pretty good descriptor, and makes it clear that the target is a triangle. The most important differentiator is the red outline, which contrasts the black-outlined star. Adding the fill is a good idea. To be absolutely certain, let me combine these all.

The final description I will use is: “It’s a triangle with a red outline, and is filled with grey polka dots.” This covers shape, outline color, and fill pattern and should allow the other person to easily identify it, despite the hidden objects.

exp2_110.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,2,"triangle, triangular",green,dot,"2,3",The triangle with the green border.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object clearly enough that someone else can identify it from a set of options. Let's break this down systematically.

First, I see a 3x3 grid with three objects displayed. The target is a triangle in the bottom-middle cell. It's highlighted with a red dashed box, which is helpful to me, but I need to focus on what properties I can use to differentiate it. I note its properties: it's a triangle, it has a green border, and it's filled with a grey polka-dot pattern. I also see a black-bordered, polka-dot triangle in the top-left, and a blue-bordered, wavy-line circle in the bottom-right. The other cells are empty.

Now, I need to identify what distinguishes the target from the distractors. I'm avoiding spatial references since those could be relative to *my* viewpoint, not the listener's. Let's compare the target to each distractor. With the black-bordered triangle, the key difference is the border color – green versus black. Both have the same polka-dot fill. Now, comparing the target to the blue-bordered circle, everything is different: shape (triangle vs. circle), border color (green vs. blue), and fill pattern (polka-dot vs. wavy line).

The goal is a concise and unambiguous description. I can't assume that what I *don't* see doesn't exist to the listener. There could be other objects, maybe even hidden by ""red curtains,"" so I need to be precise.

I start formulating descriptions. ""The green triangle"" is simple, but is it unique? The listener might see other green objects. ""The triangle with the green border"" is more specific. The crucial factor is the *border color*, as it's the most easily distinguishable feature among the visible objects. ""The object with a green border and a polka dot fill"" is also very specific.

I realize that the fill pattern is not as essential because another object shares it. The *border* is the primary differentiator among the triangles. Shape helps to distinguish the triangle from the circle. So, ""the triangle with the green border"" or ""the green-bordered triangle"" seems perfect.

I'm thinking about edge cases: could there be a hidden green circle? A green triangle with a different fill? ""The triangle with the green border"" will still work in the first scenario, but ""The triangle with the green border *and* grey polka dots"" would be necessary in the second.

I need to decide between the green border, the triangle shape and the polka dot fill: The green border is key because it's unique among the visible objects. The triangle shape is important. The polka dot fill is less helpful, as another visible object shares it. ""The triangle with the green border"" hits all the necessary notes. It's simple, accurate, and unambiguous. I also considered ""green outline"" or ""green-bordered"" but it remains a matter of minor refinement.

Ultimately, ""The triangle with the green border"" is my final choice. It’s direct, identifies the shape and unique border, and is likely to avoid confusion. It's concise and addresses the core distinguishing features. This should be sufficient based on what is visible.

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game. My objective is to describe the target object, which I see clearly is inside that dashed red box, so the other person can identify it without me saying *where* it is. I need to make the description precise enough that it's unambiguous, even if the other person is looking at a different arrangement of objects or can't see everything.

First, I identified the target. It's a triangle. Now, let's break down its properties. It has a green outline and a fill pattern of wavy horizontal grey and white lines. I have to make sure to exclude location as a descriptor.

Next, I need to analyze all the other objects in the grid – the distractors, in essence. I am seeing a red square, a black circle with vertical stripes, a black square with wavy lines, and a black circle with wavy lines. I note the pattern here is wavy lines is not unique.

I need to focus on what makes the target unique. It’s the only triangle, which is a strong starting point. Also, its green outline is another unique feature. The fill pattern (wavy lines) isn't unique, because it's shared by two other objects, so it is not a primary unique feature.

I'm starting to formulate some descriptions. ""It's the triangle"" is good, but it might not be enough if there is something hidden. ""It's the green object"" is also good, but if there's any other green shape, it fails. ""It's the green triangle"" combines these two – triangle shape and green color – and is likely the most robust option at this point. I could add ""with wavy lines inside,"" but that adds a shared feature.

So, let's refine this to make it even more robust. ""The green triangle"" is simple and effective. ""The triangle with the green outline"" is another strong contender. I could also say ""Select the triangle with the green outline."" to make it a more directive.

I'm thinking about the context of the game. I have to avoid any location clues because the layout might be different for the other person. There might be hidden objects too, so I need to make the description unambiguous even in those cases. The description must be able to stand on its own to correctly guide the other player to a specific object.

Ultimately, I want a description that's clear, concise, and unambiguous. ""The green triangle"" seems to fit the bill perfectly. It leverages the two unique features. If there are other objects, it would be simple to specify additional features.
"
exp2_112.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,"circle, circular",black,"wavy, zigzag","3,2",The circle with the wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process in Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object clearly and unambiguously so someone else can identify it. As an expert, I know the importance of precision. Let's break this down systematically.

First, I need to *really* look at the target. It's inside a red dashed box, a circle, with a thick black border, and filled with a wavy grey pattern. I'm focusing on intrinsic properties - things the listener can observe directly.

Next, I need to analyze the distractors. I've got a triangle with a checkerboard pattern, a circle with a red border and polka dots, a square with polka dots, and another triangle with a wavy pattern. Okay, this is where the *real* work begins. I need to figure out the key distinguishing features.

I consider the shape first. It's a circle, but there's *another* circle present. So, ""the circle"" is out. That's way too ambiguous. Border color? The target has a black border; the other circle is red. Pattern? The target has a wavy grey pattern.

Now, I'm formulating descriptions. I'm looking for the perfect, concise statement. I've got to combine features to make a *unique* description. Okay, ""the circle with the black border"" *works* because the other circle has a red one. But ""the object with the wavy pattern"" is *ambiguous* because that same pattern is present in another triangle.

I'm refining. ""The circle with the wavy pattern"" is very clear and concise, combines shape and pattern, and avoids ambiguity. So is ""the circle with the black border"". I now need to consider potential ambiguities. Is there a chance the listener knows the objects in a different arrangement? I cannot assume they are laid out as I see them. So, no relative location descriptions like ""the circle in the middle row"". It must be based only on properties: shape, border color, and fill pattern.

Considering all this, ""The circle with the wavy pattern"" is a very strong candidate. It is concise. ""The circle with the black border"" is also a good choice. I'm leaning toward the former because it highlights the pattern, which seems like a more prominent characteristic of the overall image.

I'm doing a final sanity check, comparing the characteristics of each object, the target, and all the distractors. ""The circle with the wavy pattern"" is unambiguous! Perfect. It rules out the other circle with the polka dot and the other triangle with the wavy pattern, as well as the square. ""The circle with the black border"" is also a good choice. It distinguishes the target from the other circle, but I'm going with the pattern because it's more descriptive.

I'll provide either ""The circle with the wavy pattern"" or ""The circle with the black outline"" as the solution. ""The circle with the wavy pattern"" feels better because the patterns are a dominant theme in this array.

exp2_113.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,"circle, circular",red,"wavy, zigzag","3,2",It's the circle with a red outline and a gray wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game and need to describe an object so someone else can pick it out. The image is a 3x3 grid. I see three visible objects and two hidden behind curtains, which is interesting for the descriptive process. My primary focus is the target object, which is highlighted.

First, I analyze the visual elements. The target is a circle with a grey wavy line pattern inside and a red outline. A triangle with a checkerboard pattern sits in the bottom-left, which I must note for differentiating descriptions. There are also two hidden objects behind red curtains with question marks. These present a degree of uncertainty I must account for.

My initial thought is ""Identify the target"". The obvious features are the shape, the wavy pattern, and the red outline. Considering the known context of the game, I need to come up with a description to let another player uniquely determine the object.

I begin formulating descriptions. ""It's a circle"" is a good starting point, but not specific enough on its own. It could be any circle. The wavy pattern is the key. ""The object with grey wavy lines inside"" is much better. To refine, I need to compare this target to the other *visible* elements: the triangle with the checkerboard pattern. The description of this item *must* differentiate the two objects, so I can start to describe my target.

I also can't assume what's *behind* the curtains. There *could* be another circle, or another object with wavy lines. This means I can't use absolute statements. I must use what's immediately visible. A good strategy is to emphasize the most distinct visual features.

I go through several drafts. ""It's a circle with a red border."" This is okay, but vague. ""It's the object with grey wavy lines."" More descriptive, but not as specific as possible. ""Select the circle that has a red outline and is filled with a grey wavy pattern."" Good, but slightly lengthy. ""The object is a circle. It has a red border, and inside there's a pattern of wavy grey lines."" A more conversational approach, but less concise.

So, I refine these descriptions. I determine that the shape and pattern are the most critical differentiating factors. The red border is useful, but not the primary element. I arrive at ""The object is a circle with a red border and a grey wavy pattern inside.""

To shorten, I try ""The circle with the wavy grey lines."" Which is a more concise version that implies the pattern is *inside* the circle. I think this description is good, even with the hidden objects, as long as I specify a *circle* with the lines.

I consider different lengths of descriptions. Finally, I combine the best elements: ""It's the circle with a red outline filled with a gray wavy pattern"". Or, in a simple way, ""It's the circle with a red outline filled with grey wavy lines"".

So, I am left with a clear choice. I arrive at a final concise description: ""It's the circle with a red outline and gray wavy lines inside"". I feel it provides enough detail to distinguish it from anything currently visible, even if the hidden objects are identical.

Therefore, my final description is: ""It's the circle with a red outline and gray wavy lines inside.""

exp2_114.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,square,red,"wavy, zigzag","1,2",Select the square with the wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing a Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with acting as a speaker in a reference game. My primary objective is clear: describe the highlighted object in the image so that someone else can identify it. No spatial descriptors, got it. Let's break this down systematically.

First, I need to *really* analyze the image. It's a 3x3 grid, though only three cells are populated. I see a green star with vertical stripes, a red star with a checkerboard, and a grey square with a red border and wavy lines. No hidden objects, so that simplifies things. The dashed box clearly highlights the grey square with the wavy lines.

Now, I'm thinking about how to frame my description. I need to make it uniquely identifying. I'll mentally compare the target (the square with the wavy lines) to the distractors (the two stars). I'm focusing on shape, pattern, and color, looking for the most distinguishing features.

The square shape immediately jumps out. That's a strong, unambiguous property. Also, the wavy line pattern is also unique. No other object has that pattern. Color alone is tricky. The target's border is red, which is shared with one of the stars. ""The grey one"" could be ambiguous. So shape and pattern seem the safest bets.

I need to formulate the best utterance. Using just the shape, ""Select the square,"" would probably work. Or, just the pattern, ""Select the object with wavy lines,"" would also do the trick. Combining them adds clarity without becoming overly verbose: ""Select the square object that has wavy lines inside."" This seems like a good, solid description.

I'm reviewing the instructions one last time. No spatial locations, check. No hidden objects, good. The target is clearly highlighted. I’ve avoided spatial terms and confirmed that the objects are all visible.

I am re-evaluating the image one more time and I think I'm going to opt for ""Select the square object."" This is the most unambiguous description. If I were to provide a more specific description, I would provide, ""The target is the square with the wavy pattern inside.""

The strategy here is to focus on what is unique: ""The square with a wavy pattern"". This is clear, concise, and avoids any potential misinterpretations.

exp2_115.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,"triangle, triangular",green,dot,"3,3",The triangle filled with dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing a Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with describing an object within an image grid. My mission: to provide enough information for someone else to identify the target, which I see highlighted in a dashed red box – which, by the way, I shouldn't mention directly. The goal is clarity and robustness. Here's how I'm approaching this:

1.  **Analyze the Visuals:** The target is in the bottom right cell. It's a triangle. It has a green border, and its interior is filled with a grey dot pattern. I make note of all this, including the fact that the red box is irrelevant for the description.

2.  **Scrutinize the Distractors:** I quickly scan the other objects in the grid: a red-bordered circle with wavy lines, a red-bordered square with dots, a black-bordered star with vertical stripes, and a blue-bordered triangle with vertical stripes. The remaining cells are empty. This is crucial for comparison and contrast.

3.  **Formulate a Precise Description:** My initial thought is to just say ""the triangle,"" but that’s immediately inadequate. There are *two* triangles. I start thinking about the key features that differentiate the target: the green border, the dot pattern inside.

    *   **""The green triangle.""** Could work as there is no other green object, but that is not the most salient feature.
    *   **""The triangle with the green border.""** This is even more precise and robust. No other object shares this feature.
    *   **""The triangle with dots inside.""** This also seems unique, since the other triangle has stripes.
    *   **""The green shape with dots inside.""** This has shape, color and pattern, so this is robust, but possibly a bit long.

4.  **Combining Features for Robustness:** I want to ensure my description works even if the other person can't see the same thing I do. Thinking ahead, and imagining this, my main criteria now is that there are no objects hidden in the view of the listener that share the described features.

5.  **Addressing Potential Ambiguities and Constraints:** I'm not allowed to use location. The hidden objects are a possibility, which pushes me to focus on intrinsic properties of the target object. It can't be dependent on my specific view.

6.  **Select the Best Description:** ""The green triangle with dots"" is solid, but ""The green triangle"" works as the only green thing visible. ""The triangle filled with dots"" is also a great contender, as the other triangle has stripes. ""The shape with the green border"" is super clear and simple. However, sometimes shorter is better. What is the most salient and useful characteristic?
    *   ""Select the triangle that has dots inside."" This is a clear instruction. The other triangle has stripes. The other dotted shape is a square. So this works.
    *   I'll break the description into components: shape, border colour, fill pattern
    *   Comparing with the other objects, the most salient features is the color of the border and the combination of shape and pattern. The other triangle has stripes. The other dotted shape is a square.
    *   ""It's the triangle that's filled with dots."" I feel confident in this.
    *   The other triangle has stripes. The other object with dots is a square. I'm choosing based on the most robust and unique features of the target object.

Finally, I am going with ""The triangle filled with dots."" This is specific, unambiguous, and, most importantly, should work regardless of what's *not* visible to either me or the other person.
"
exp2_116.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,star,black,stripe,"3,3",The star with vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game and need to describe an object so someone else can identify it. I've got to make sure I'm following the rules. First, let's nail down what I *know*: I'm the speaker, the user has given me an image with multiple objects, and some of the objects are hidden behind those red curtains. A red dashed box is highlighting the target. Spatial locations are off limits, as the listener's arrangement may vary.

I start by looking at the image – a 3x3 grid. I see two hidden objects (Curtain1, Curtain2), a green-bordered triangle with wavy gray/white fill (WavyTriangle), and *the* target: a black-bordered star with vertical gray/white stripes (StripedStar). I'm looking at this StripedStar.

The core of this is identifying the *unique* properties of the StripedStar. My plan is to start with shape, outline color, and pattern to give the best description.

The biggest visual clue here is that it's a star, clearly different from the visible WavyTriangle. The fill pattern (vertical stripes) is also a strong differentiator from the wavy pattern on the triangle. The border is black. This black outline is distinct from the green outline of the triangle.

I'm thinking about how to describe the target:

The biggest challenges are the hidden objects. Could there be another star behind those curtains? Or another object with vertical stripes? I can't know for sure, but I have to try and be as descriptive as I can while not revealing what is behind the curtain.

So, I need to choose the best descriptors, and I've focused on shape and pattern. The combination of shape and pattern is a solid approach. The shape of the star is a key feature and so are the vertical stripes. So, the goal is to make a description that highlights these features. The other descriptor, the color of the outline, can be another descriptor to avoid ambiguity.

My thoughts are:
*   ""The star with vertical stripes."" (Concise, but is it unique enough?)
*   ""The star with the black outline and vertical striped pattern."" (More complete and possibly more robust).
*   ""The star filled with vertical stripes.""

I feel I should focus on conciseness but be as descriptive as possible. The *shape* and *pattern* are the best bets, so something like ""The star with vertical stripes"" is a good starting point. I could add ""The star with a black outline and vertical stripes"" but it may be overkill, since the listener may not know about the black outline without further information. I can't be *too* verbose, I have to be succinct.

I evaluate the description. Is it good enough?

I think the best option is: ""The star with vertical stripes."" That combines the iconic shape and the salient internal pattern. That should be a good description!
"
exp2_117.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,star,black,"wavy, zigzag","3,3",The star with the black outline has a wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the highlighted target object so the other person can pick it out. I can't use spatial cues, which I'm used to doing, like ""the bottom right one,"" which requires a little bit of adjustment on my part, since spatial cues may not always be available. This means I need to focus on its unique features. The target has a red dashed box, so I know which one I need to describe.

First, I need to analyze the target itself. It's a star shape, black outline, and filled with a grey and white wavy pattern.

Next, I look at the *other* visible objects. There's another star. It has a green outline and a grey and white striped pattern inside. And there are two other objects, hidden behind question-mark-covered curtains. The other person *does* know what's behind the curtains. I don't. This introduces uncertainty and means I have to be extra careful. The other objects' features are unknown to me and, while irrelevant to them, must be considered as a potential point of confusion for the other person in selecting the target.

I'm starting to formulate descriptions. My first thought is ""The star with the black outline."" Is that enough? Well, it differentiates it from the green-outlined star, but I need to account for what might be hidden. What if one of the hidden objects is *also* a black outline, and that creates ambiguity?

So, I need more detail. ""The star with the black outline and a wavy pattern inside."" The other star has stripes, so the wavy pattern should distinguish it. This is more specific. Shape, outline color, and internal pattern all are mentioned. But, again, could *another* object behind the curtain also be a star with a black outline and a wavy pattern? I need to consider that.

I explore alternatives. ""The grey star?"" But the other star has a grey and white pattern too, so that is not helpful. ""The star with the wavy pattern."" This is better, because the other visible star is striped. Maybe that's enough? ""The star with the black border."" Also a good descriptor.

Now I start combining features. ""The star with a black outline has a wavy pattern inside."" Or, ""Select the star that has a black outline and a wavy grey and white pattern inside."" This is very precise.

Let's refine it further, keeping it concise but clear. ""The star with the black outline and wavy fill."" ""The star with the wavy gray and white pattern and a black border."" ""The star filled with a wavy pattern."" The pattern is probably the most distinguishing feature, and thus the most important part of the description to mention. With the unknown objects, the pattern seems like a more complex feature to replicate than an outline, so this can reduce the chances of ambiguity.

To make my final decision, I need to consider what separates the two stars. Outline color (green vs black) and the pattern inside (stripes vs waves). Mentioning both seems safest.

So, I end up with: ""The star with a black outline has a wavy pattern inside."" That's a solid description. Let's make sure it's clear and unambiguous. The term ""wavy pattern"" should be pretty clear; it really does look like waves. The contrast is strong to the other star. The colors are also quite different: black vs green outline, and wavy grey/white vs striped grey/white.

The simpler, ""The star with the wavy pattern,"" could work, since the other star is striped. Also, ""The star with the black outline."" Should it be enough? Maybe. I still want to be safe and clear.

Therefore, ""The star with the black outline has a wavy pattern inside."" This feels good.

Alternatively, I could also say, ""The star with a black outline and a grey and white wavy pattern.""

Or, ""There is a star with a black border and a wavy pattern inside.""

I still think that the first one is the best, because it's concise, clear, and unambiguous. This is my final answer.

exp2_118.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,star,black,dot,"3,1",It's the star filled with grey dots.,"**My Thought Process: Selecting the Target Object**

Okay, the task is a reference game. I need to describe a target object so someone else can identify it, and the red dashed box is the clue. My brain's whirring already, looking for a clear and concise description that *uniquely* identifies the target. It's a star, with a black outline and grey dot fill, located in the top right.

First, I'm identifying key features. Shape is a star. Outline color is black, which is immediately interesting. Fill is a grey dot pattern. I'm comparing it to the distractors: a green-outlined square with dots, a red-outlined triangle with a checkerboard, and a green-outlined star with grey wavy lines. It's quickly apparent that the black outline is a unique feature.

I'm mentally running through different descriptions. ""The star with the black outline"" is concise and unambiguous. ""The star filled with dots"" also sounds good, differentiating it from the wavy-lined star and the square. Even ""the object with a black outline"" is technically correct and very efficient.

Now, I'm thinking about the most similar distractors and trying to avoid any ambiguity. Both the dotted square and the other star with grey lines are close, but I need to make sure my descriptor is strong enough to select the correct object. ""The black star"" is potentially slightly less clear; the outline isn't the whole object. ""The star filled with grey dots"" is solid. It's easy to differentiate it from all the other objects by their unique features. I want to make sure the target has more than one feature that separates it from the others.

""The star with the black outline"" and ""the star filled with grey dots"" are very strong and clear, so I'm deciding between those two. I'm going with ""the star filled with grey dots"" because it is a direct description of the feature itself. However, because the other objects also have features, like the ""green wavy star"", those two descriptions may be used interchangeably depending on the context.

I'm mentally validating this: does it work? Is there *any* other object matching ""star filled with grey dots""? No. The dot pattern is unique; the shape is unique. I am confident that is true.

I'm thinking about making the description more concise: ""the dotted star,"" or even ""the star with the black outline"". I think ""the dotted star"" is the clearest and least prone to misinterpretation in this specific grid.

Finally, I'm refining the wording to sound natural: ""It's the star that's filled with grey dots."" That's the one. I'm ready to communicate that. ""The dotted star."" Perfect.

Okay, so the user wants me to play the role of a speaker in this reference game. My primary objective is to generate a description that will allow another person to accurately identify the target object. I've got a 3x3 grid here, with a few objects visible.

First, I need to pinpoint the target. The red dashed box points it out as a triangle with a red border and grey dots within. Now I need to consider all the other objects present so I can distinguish the target object. There is a square with a blue border and grey vertical stripes. There's a circle with a black border and grey wavy lines and three other squares: one with a black border and grey dots, and another with a black border and grey wavy lines.

I quickly realize that a ""triangle"" is the strongest and most unique feature. It's the only triangle present. The red border is another strong differentiator, as only the target object has that color. The grey dots inside are also a factor. I need to make sure my description works even if the distractors are arranged differently for the listener, so I can't rely on spatial relations. The user specified not to rely on any spatial location or relationships. Also, there's a point about other objects potentially hidden from view behind a curtain. While that doesn't apply to this *specific* image, I should keep that rule in mind for future instances.

To start, ""the triangle"" would be a simple and effective description, but it's always good to be thorough and consider combinations. ""The object with the red border"" is also concise and unambiguous. I also think about combinations, like ""the triangle with grey dots inside."" But, a closer look shows that there's also a square with grey dots. I'll need to specify either the shape or the border color for that reason. So, saying just ""the object with dots"" is not enough.

Since ""triangle"" and ""red border"" are unique characteristics, I should be able to convey the target object with a combination of those features. I'll use those as primary distinctions and combine them with the fill pattern to be very precise. So, I will try a few different utterances to be very thorough.

I believe the most precise and robust description is ""The triangle filled with grey dots."" This will make it very clear to the listener which object I am referring to.

Okay, so I'm presented with an image and tasked with guiding someone to select a specific object within it – a reference game, essentially. My immediate thought is to break down the problem methodically.

First, I observe the image, noting it's a 3x3 grid with both empty and occupied cells. The target is highlighted, so that helps. I see the target is a square with vertical grey and white stripes and a solid blue border, positioned in the top row, middle column. There's another object visible - a grey and white checkerboard square with a solid green border, and two hidden objects behind curtains, also squares. Those hidden objects are variables, and my description has to accommodate those variables.

My next step is object identification. I've already identified the target object: its distinctive features are its pattern (vertical stripes), colors (grey and white), border (solid blue), and shape (square).

Now, I analyze the contrasting features. The other visible object has a checkerboard pattern and a green border. This is critical. I'm thinking I must leverage these differences in my description to ensure clear identification. I also mentally acknowledge the hidden objects: I have no information about them, but I need to anticipate their potential similarity to the target object.

My strategy? Specificity. I'll include multiple distinctive features in my description. I plan to start with the most prominent, the pattern, then add the colors, and finally, the border. The border is a defining trait.

Thus, my proposed utterance is: ""Select the square that has grey and white vertical stripes inside a solid blue border."" I'm confident that these details – grey and white vertical stripes *and* a solid blue border – make for a unique identifier.

Finally, I review the description. Is it accurate? Yes. Specific? Absolutely. Does it need spatial location? Not necessarily, the pattern/color/border combo seems sufficient. Concise? Yes, I'm aiming for clarity without unnecessary length. This should be sufficient even if the hidden objects have similar properties.
