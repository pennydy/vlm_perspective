I should emphasize its uniqueness compared to others, specifically noting that it’s the only one with a green outline and dotted interior. So, I could say something like, “Choose the green-outlined triangle with gray polka dots inside.”"

I need to create a referring expression for a target object, specifically the star with vertical stripes and a black outline. The grid consists of a 3x3 layout with some hidden elements due to curtains. I need to ensure the description is robust enough to identify the star among other visible objects like the green-bordered triangle and empty white squares. My aim is to convey the unique attributes of the star without relying on spatial locations."

I need to ensure that I’m describing visible shapes accurately, even though there might be hidden ones in the other version. The instructions mention that some objects are behind a red curtain, which adds a layer of uncertainty for us. I should avoid using spatial terms like ""top right"" and instead refer to grid coordinates. For example, I could say, ""Choose the star with gray polka dots and a black outline, not the green-outlined wavy one."" That keeps things concise!"

I want to ensure my description is clear and unambiguous. The shape itself should be unique; saying ""the triangle"" could work, but if it’s hidden or not obvious, I should also include its color or pattern for better identification. So, my answer needs to be a brief yet complete description that covers those aspects. It’s all about making it easy to understand!"

I need to create a clear referring expression for the target object, which is a square with vertical gray and white stripes bordered by blue. It's in a grid layout of 3x3 with some empty spaces, a green checkerboard pattern, and two red curtains. I should avoid using vague spatial terms and instead focus on unique features. I'll emphasize that the target only displays stripes, specifically instructing to select that square while noting other visible patterns and objects for clarity."
