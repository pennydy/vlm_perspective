I need to uniquely describe the target shape, which is a circle with a black outline and a grey wavy fill. Other related shapes include a circle with a dotted red outline and a grey dot fill, a square with a black outlined dotted fill, a checkered triangle, and a wavy triangle. The key point is that the target shape is the only circle with a wavy fill and a black border. I can't mention any positions."

I need to come up with a referential expression for the target, which is a wavy circle gray inside a red border. There are also visible elements like a checker triangle and two hidden curtains. I can't use spatial terms like ""top right,” and I need to ensure the description is distinctive. Something like ""the gray circle with wavy stripes inside a red border"" might work. I must avoid assumptions about the hidden elements, but I think it captures the essence!"

I need to say something like: ""Choose the gray square with a wavy pattern; it features a red border."" It's important to focus on aspects like color, shape, and pattern, while avoiding spatial terms. I have other options as well, like the green striped star or the red checkered star. So, I need to make sure my phrasing reflects these distinctions clearly for the user."

I’m looking for a short, clear way to refer to a green-outlined triangle that has a dotted interior. I also have other shapes to distinguish: a black star with stripes, a blue striped triangle, a wavy red circle, and a dotted red square. What I really need to clarify is the distinction between the two triangles, which are the blue striped triangle and the green dotted triangle. This should help avoid any confusion!"

I need to refer to a striped star while avoiding spatial details. The objects I’m thinking of are blank white squares, two red curtains, a green bordered wavy triangle, and the striped star with a black outline. I’m considering how to describe the striped star without depending on hidden aspects, as they could confuse things. I think the best description would be: ""striped star outline, black with vertical gray stripes, no color border unlike the green triangle."" I need to ensure the description is clear and complete!"

I need to describe the design elements without using spatial words like ""bottom right."" I should focus on unique features instead. For the gray star, I'll refer to it as having a black outline and a wavy interior pattern. It’s important to avoid any mention of visibility since the curtains are unknown. So, I can simply say: ""the gray star with a black outline and wavy pattern inside."" This way, I'm being clear and descriptive!"

I need to come up with a good way to describe a target pattern. One specific target is a star outline in black with grey polka dots inside and no outer color border. Then, there are other patterns like a green square with polka dots, a red triangle checker, and a green wavy star. I think I’ll say, ""the star with a dotted pattern and no colored border, just the black outline."""

I need to describe the target shape clearly. It's a red triangle outline with a dotted interior, and I have to distinguish it from other shapes like squares and circles that have stripes, waves, or dots. My final instruction should simply be: ""Pick the red-outlined triangle with a dotted fill."" I won't reference any location since that’s not necessary here. That should help ensure clarity!"
exp2_120.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,square,blue,stripe,"2,1","Pick the square with thin vertical gray and white stripes (the striped pattern), not the checkerboard and not either red curtain.","**Clarifying visual pattern**

I need a concise term to refer to the target pattern, which consists of vertical gray stripes in a square format. I want to make sure I'm distinguishing it clearly from patterns like checkerboard or curtains, but I need to avoid anything spatially oriented. It feels a bit tricky, but I'm focusing on finding the right wording that captures the essence of this pattern without any confusion. Let's see what fits best!"
