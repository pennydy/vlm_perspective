I’m looking at the instructions for a reference game where I see a 3x3 grid. It’s actually three columns and three rows, but some positions are hidden behind red curtains with question marks. My job is to describe the target object so the listener can identify it, but I can’t use explicit spatial references like ""bottom right."" Instead, I’ll rely on the object properties and how they relate to visible items without using vague spatial terms.

I'm focusing on objects with various shapes like triangles, circles, and squares. The colors I'm considering include blue, red, green, and dark grey or black.
