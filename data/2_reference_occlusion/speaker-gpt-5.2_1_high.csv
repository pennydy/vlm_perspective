I need to describe a target object, which is a square with a thick black border and a checkered gray and white filling. I should clearly state that it’s a square and not a triangle or circle. The description shouldn't include spatial references. Instead, I can focus on mentioning that it has a solid black frame, and the interior features a checkerboard pattern.

I need to provide a clear description so that others can select the correct target. It seems like there’s a 3x3 grid layout. In the top-left, there's a curtain; the top-middle holds a square outlined in red with grey polka dots; the top-right contains a dotted circle with a black border. The target is a dashed red box around the top-middle dotted square. I'll say: “the square filled with grey polka dots,” avoiding spatial references while mentioning the red border."

I need to refer to a specific target object: a circle with vertical grey stripes and a green border. I shouldn’t focus on its spatial relationships but rather describe it clearly! There's also another circle featuring a wavy pattern, and a star with a vertical stripe interior. Additionally, there's a star outlined in black with grey stripes.

I need to create a description to identify the target object, which is in a 3x3 scene grid. The top row has two triangles: one is striped vertical gray, and the other, the target, is surrounded by a dashed red box. I must avoid using spatial language and instead focus on properties. I’ll describe it as a triangle with a black border and a light gray fill decorated with dark gray polka dots to differentiate it from the striped one."

I need to describe my target to someone else. I'm thinking about a grid layout, specifically a 3x3 configuration. So that's three columns and three rows, right? In this context, there are visible objects: a star with a dotted pattern and a black outline in the middle-left cell. Two curtains are positioned in the bottom left and bottom middle, hiding something. My target, which is in the bottom right, is a triangle with a red outline and filled with grey dots on a white background."

I need to provide a description of a triangle that's got a green border and filled with gray polka dots. It's positioned in the bottom middle. I want to avoid mentioning any spatial aspects. I should clearly state that it’s a green-outlined triangle with a polka dot interior. There’s also another triangle with a black outline and a blue circle that has a wavy edge.

I need to come up with a referring expression for a specific triangle. It has a green border, and it's filled with gray wavy stripes. I want to keep it unique and avoid spatial descriptions. Along with that, there are other shapes to consider, like a checkered square with a red border, circles with vertical and wavy stripes, and another square that's wavy.
