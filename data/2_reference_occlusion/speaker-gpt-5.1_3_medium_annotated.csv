I’m focusing on describing the target object, which is a red-outlined triangle filled with a gray wavy pattern. To make it unique among other shapes in a 3x3 grid—including a green-outlined star, a dotted circle, a checkerboard square, and a striped star—I need a concise description without any spatial references.

I need to provide a clear reference expression for the target without using spatial words like ""bottom left,"" since arrangements could vary.

I'm pondering the hidden shapes, and it's tricky since they could be similar to the known triangles. The listener has knowledge that I don't, so I need to craft a description that accounts for all nine possibilities without making assumptions.

I need to create a referring expression for a specific target: a wavy-patterned circle with a black border. Other nearby shapes include a checkerboard triangle and a dotted circle.

I need to focus on the target, which is a wavy gray circle with a red border. It’s crucial to avoid using spatial directions like top, bottom, left, or right.
