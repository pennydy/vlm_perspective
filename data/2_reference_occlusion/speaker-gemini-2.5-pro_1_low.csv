exp2_001.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,2,triangle,black,stripe,"3,3",Select the triangle that has vertical stripes inside of it.,"**My Thought Process: Deciding on the Best Description**

Okay, the task is a reference game. I need to guide someone to a specific object within a grid, but I can't use spatial cues. I see a 3x3 grid with three objects: two with wavy lines, and one I need to identify. The target is a triangle with vertical stripes. I also know there could be hidden objects, so my description needs to be precise.

First, I break down the problem. I examine the image. I clearly see the objects and their features: shapes, patterns, colors (mainly gray and white with thick black outlines). The target is the triangle with vertical stripes. I need to describe it in a way that differentiates it from the other triangle (wavy horizontal lines) and the star (also wavy horizontal lines) and *any* potential hidden objects.

My first thought – ""The triangle"" – is useless. There are two triangles. ""The triangle with stripes"" is better, but it's still not specific enough. I'm thinking I need to be *precise* on that pattern. I considered ""vertical lines"" versus ""vertical stripes."" The lines are straight, so that's a key attribute. ""The triangle with vertical stripes"" seems pretty good, contrasting with the wavy horizontal patterns on the other objects. I also thought about combining the features: ""The shape is a triangle and it is filled with vertical stripes.""

I then do a mental evaluation. ""The triangle with vertical stripes"" is a strong contender. It uses both shape and a distinct pattern to describe the object. It's concise and unlikely to be confused, even with unseen objects, unless there's an unseen triangle with another type of vertical stripes. And the other patterns are wavy and horizontal. ""The triangle with straight lines"" is also a good description.

I run a final check. I'm not using any spatial references. My description is specific enough to handle hidden objects. It's clear and unambiguous.

So, I'm settling on ""The triangle with vertical stripes."" It's clear, specific, and should work.

exp2_002.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,square,blue,checker,"3,2",It's the checkerboard pattern with a blue border.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to describe the target object so that another person can identify it without ambiguity. I need to be precise and, crucially, avoid any descriptions that rely on relative positions, since the user has pointed out that arrangements might be different for the other person.

First, I assessed the visual environment. I see a 3x3 grid, a few objects in open cells, and two objects hidden behind curtains. The target is highlighted in a red box, a helpful indicator for me.

My process starts with identifying the target. It's in the middle row, rightmost column, and it stands out. It's a square with a blue border, and inside is a clear checkerboard pattern of alternating grey and white squares.

Next, I noted the other objects to use them as points of comparison. There's a five-pointed star with grey dots in the top-left cell, and a square with wavy lines with a green border in the bottom-right cell. I had to factor in the unknown objects hidden behind the curtains. I can't rely on position, so I need to make the description precise.

When formulating the description, the primary thing that stood out was the checkerboard pattern. That's a strong feature. I need to mention its color as a discriminator: the grey and white squares. And I can't forget the border: a blue border is important.

I then went through a refinement phase. ""The object with the checkerboard pattern"" is my starting point. That would work, but what about the hidden objects? Could any of them be checkerboards? Not likely with what I can see. Now, I have to add the border to refine the description even more. ""The square with the blue border"". Combining these is a good path forward. I combined it into the phrase, ""The object is a checkerboard pattern with a blue border.""

A key consideration is the arrangement. Since the user said the objects might be differently arranged for the other person, I must omit any spatial descriptors like ""the one on the right"" or ""the one in the middle."" I need to be describing the object itself, not its relative location.

The final check of the description came next. ""It's a square with a blue border."" That's good since the other bordered square is green. ""Inside, there's a grey and white checkerboard pattern."" That's more detailed and differentiates it from the other objects. Let's combine this into a short, concise description: ""The object with a blue border and a checkerboard pattern."" The important parts are the pattern and the color of the border, because they are unique. This is pretty strong, even with the unknown objects.

The output will be, ""The object is a checkerboard pattern with a blue border."" Clear. Concise. No spatial references. It's all about the unique combination of visual properties of the target.

exp2_003.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,4,circle,red,wavy,"1,3",It's the circle with the red outline and the grey wavy pattern inside.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the descriptor in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to guide the listener to correctly identify the target object. It's a 3x3 grid, with some objects visible and two hidden. I can't use spatial terms, so I need a description that is both precise and distinctive. Here's my thought process.

First, I need to thoroughly **analyze the visual information**. I see three distinct objects: two stars (one blue, one black, with checkerboard and polka dot patterns respectively) and a red-outlined circle with a wavy, grey and white pattern. The target, helpfully highlighted, is the circle with the wavy pattern. There are also two mystery objects behind curtains, which I need to account for in my description.

My **initial description starts with shape**. It has to be the most salient feature. ""It's a circle"" is a good starting point to immediately eliminate the stars. But I can't stop there. I have to make it unique from not only the visible objects, but also the hidden ones. So, I will **add more details**.

The next obvious feature is the **pattern**. The wavy grey and white pattern is fairly distinct and should help differentiate the target.

I also take note of the **colors and outline** to further sharpen the description. A red outline is another detail.

I then move to **formulate the description**. I want to be concise, but complete. I started with ""Select the circle with the wavy pattern inside."" Then, I refined it, expanding on the details for more clarity: ""The object is a circle with a red border and a grey and white wavy pattern inside.""

I also **analyzed potential distractors** (the other visible objects). Since the other objects are stars, the shape alone will differentiate the target. I need a description that ensures that the listener gets the correct object.

Finally, I **iterate and refine**. I want to be certain that my description is unambiguous.

My final choice is: ""The object is a circle with a red outline and a wavy grey and white pattern inside."" This is a robust description that clearly identifies the target, hopefully even when the hidden objects are considered.
"
exp2_004.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,square,blue,checker,"3,3",The object is a square with a blue border and a grey and white checkerboard pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the goal is clear: I need to describe this object so someone else can identify it, acting as a speaker in this reference game. The target is highlighted, so I'll start there. First, I’ll analyze the target itself, then the distractors to determine its unique characteristics.

The target object is a square. Its pattern is a checkerboard of grey and white squares, and the outline is blue. I must avoid using positional terms, as the listener's arrangement might vary.

Now, I look at the other objects. The top middle one is a triangle with grey dots and a black outline. The bottom left is a star with grey dots and a green outline, while the bottom middle star has vertical grey stripes and a blue outline.

To find the best description, I need to identify what's unique. The target square is the only square. It's the only one with a checkerboard pattern, too. While two objects have a blue outline, the checkerboard and the shape are the best, most straightforward differentiators. It's the only object that has a grey and white pattern on a white background. It's a subtle distinction.

Now I’ll start formulating my description. I could just say ""It's a square,"" but I can strengthen it with ""It's a square with a checkerboard pattern."" I could go even further, and I might say, ""The square has a blue border and is filled with a grey and white checkerboard pattern.""

I’m aiming for clarity and conciseness, so I’ll refine: “The object is a square with a checkerboard pattern inside.” Or even simpler: “Select the checkerboard.” Or ""Select the square.""

I’ll check for potential ambiguities. ""Checkerboard"" is a common term, so I should be good. If they mix up the shapes, the pattern should help. I’m thinking about that ""red curtain"" mentioned in the prompt. I don't see one. But I have to remember that I need to be *super* specific to avoid accidentally describing something hidden.

Okay, let's finalize the description. ""It's a square"" works, as does ""It has a checkerboard pattern."" Combining them is safest: ""The object is a square with a blue border and a grey and white checkerboard pattern inside."" Or, ""The square with the checkerboard pattern."" I’m choosing a simple but complete description: ""The object is a square with a checkerboard pattern."" This clearly distinguishes it from the others.
"
exp2_005.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,square,blue,wavy,"2,3",Select the square that has a wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing a Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being asked to describe an object in a reference game, my goal is to help someone else identify a specific item. I need to make the description clear and unambiguous.

First, I have to *analyze* the target. It's a square, with a blue border, and a grey/white wavy, horizontal line pattern inside. It’s in the bottom middle cell of a grid, but I must avoid using any positional language as the person I am talking to will see a potentially differently arranged grid.

Next, I need to look at the *other* objects – the distractors. There's a blue-bordered triangle with a checkerboard pattern, a red-bordered square with a checkerboard pattern, and a blue-bordered star with vertical stripes. There are also empty cells, and the prompt mentions a red curtain but I do not see any of that.

Now, the core of the task: *formulating* a description that uniquely identifies the target. ""The square"" isn't enough because there's another square. ""The object with the blue border"" isn't enough, since the triangle and the star also have a blue border. But ""The square with the blue border"" seems unique, as does ""The object with the wavy pattern.""

I *compare* these options. ""The square with the blue border"" uses two features and successfully singles out the target. ""The object with the wavy pattern"" is even stronger, it uses just one feature that isn't shared by any other object. Combining, ""The blue square with the wavy pattern"" is very specific.

I need to *refine* the description. I consider different ways to phrase it for clarity. ""Select the object with the wavy pattern,"" ""Please pick the square that has a blue border,"" and ""I'm looking at a square with a wavy pattern inside."" The prompt wants me to ""talk to someone"". Being concise and clear is the priority.

Re-evaluating, the pattern is the key differentiator; no other object has that. ""The object with the wavy pattern"" is the most efficient. ""The blue square"" is also a good, unique description. Let me combine features for clarity. ""It's the square with the wavy pattern inside"" seems robust. I could also say ""The blue square with the wavy pattern"" but that is somewhat redundant.

I want the most concise, yet fully distinguishing description. The pattern is the most unique. The second salient feature is the ""blue square."" I need to find the most natural combination.

I consider different phrasings. ""Select the square that has the wavy lines inside"" is good, as is ""Select the square with the blue border."" Both would work. The wavy pattern is the key visual characteristic that is unique.

A final check confirms the uniqueness of my key features: the wavy pattern or the ""blue square.""

My final answer? **""Select the square that has the wavy lines inside.""** or **""Select the square with the blue border.""** I'm happy with either one.
"
exp2_006.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,circle,black,checker,"2,1",The circle with the checkerboard pattern.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game. My goal is to describe a specific object so someone else can pick it out. The target object is highlighted, no spatial cues allowed, and I just need to focus on what's visible. Seems straightforward.

First, I need to analyze the scene. It's a 3x3 grid with different objects in some of the cells. Let's see... I've got a circle with a black outline and a checkerboard pattern (that's the target!), a red-outlined checkerboard triangle, a blue-outlined dotted square, a blue-outlined checkerboard star, and a red-outlined circle with a wavy line pattern. Good, I've got a handle on the visual elements.

Now, how to make this description unambiguous? ""Circle"" is too generic – there are two of those. ""Checkerboard"" is also not enough on its own. I need a combination of features that uniquely identifies the target. So, let's look at the properties of each object. I've got: shape, outline color, and fill pattern for each.

I've got it - I should compare the features to distinguish the target from other objects. The target is a ""circle"" with a ""black outline"" and ""checkerboard pattern.""

*   I could go with, ""The object with the black outline"" as it's the simplest.
*   ""The circle with the checkerboard pattern"" is also a good option. That combination uniquely identifies it because no other object shares both those features. The other circle is the red outline, wavy lines. The other checkerboard items are a star and triangle.

Let's test potential descriptions: I could say, ""The circle,"" but no good - there's another. ""The object with the checkerboard pattern"" is similarly not specific enough.

Okay, I'm thinking... The other circle has a wavy pattern and a red outline. ""The object with the black outline"" is good. But it seems more intuitive to focus on the target's distinctive appearance. The circle with a checkerboard pattern *feels* more descriptive.

Let's re-evaluate all items, feature by feature.
*   Circle, black outline, checkerboard fill (Target)
*   Circle, red outline, wavy fill
*   Triangle, red outline, checkerboard fill
*   Star, blue outline, checkerboard fill

I must consider the most salient feature. To distinguish it from Distractor 1, I can mention either the fill or the outline color. From the other two, I have to mention the shape, ""circle"".

I need to mention shape *and* either pattern or outline. The circle with a checkerboard pattern should be unique! ""The circle with the checkerboard pattern"" ...Yep, that works. It's concise. It avoids spatial references. It's unique.
I'm confident. The description: ""The circle with the checkerboard pattern.""
"
exp2_007.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,circle,red,stripe,"1,3",Select the circle with the red border.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: describe the highlighted target object so the listener can identify it correctly. I can see the target, indicated by the red dashed box, and I need to formulate an instruction that's both accurate and unambiguous, even if the listener has a different perspective or potentially more information (like what's behind those curtains).

First, I'm analyzing the visual information. I see a 3x3 grid. Some cells are empty, others contain objects. In the visible cells, I can see circles with vertical grey stripes in the bottom row. One has a red border, the other a blue one. There are also two ""hidden"" objects behind red curtains with question marks in the middle row, but I can't use these for my description. The location of the target doesn't matter; the listener's view might be different, so location-based descriptions are out.

My immediate focus is on the distinguishing features. I need to make the *right* distinction between the objects I *can* see. The target is a circle, and it has vertical grey stripes inside it. More importantly, it has a red border. The other visible circle, however, has a blue border. That border color is the key differentiator.

So, I need to convey this salient feature clearly. I've considered a few options. I could describe the stripes, but that's redundant given the simple layout. ""The circle with the red border"" is the most direct and effective description. I could also say ""The grey-striped circle that is outlined in red"" to be even more descriptive, but I'm going with simple clarity.

My final instruction, then, is: ""Select the circle with the red border."" This is a concise, precise, and hopefully effective description that gets straight to the key visual difference.
"
exp2_008.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,triangle,blue,stripe,"3,1",The object filled with vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game. The goal is to describe a target object in an image so that someone else can identify it. Here's what I'm thinking, step by step:

1.  **Analyze the Visuals:** First, I'm taking in the whole scene. It's a 3x3 grid, a classic setup. There are a few objects scattered around the cells, and the target is clearly marked with a red dashed box. Alright, it's a blue triangle, and this triangle has vertical gray stripes.

2.  **Compare and Contrast:** Now, I'm moving on to the distractors. I need to understand how the target is *different*. I'm seeing squares with green and red borders, a star with a blue border, a circle with a green border, and some empty spaces. All the filled shapes, except the target, have a gray wavy pattern as fill.

3.  **Uniqueness is Key:** Let's pinpoint what makes the target unique. *Shape*: It's a triangle, and there are no other triangles. That's a strong start. *Color*: The border is blue, but so is the star's border. So, “blue object” isn't quite enough. ""Blue triangle"" might be. *Fill Pattern*: Bingo! Vertical gray stripes. No one else has that. The other filled objects all have the wavy gray fill. *Border Style*: They all have solid borders, so that's not helping me.

4.  **Formulating Expressions:** I'm strategizing how to describe the target. I'm going to start with the most obvious and straightforward approaches. The first is ""The triangle"" or ""the object that is a triangle."" This is sufficient, as there is only one triangle in the image. The second strategy is ""The object with vertical stripes"". This is also sufficient. I can also try to combine features for robustness. I could say ""The blue triangle with vertical stripes."" A bit more, but maybe more clear.

5.  **Listener Perspective:** I'm remembering that the other person might not see the objects arranged the same way I do. So, I can't use locations like ""top right."" There could also be hidden objects. In this case, the image notes the possibility, but no objects are currently hidden. I should still create a description as if the only objects in the image are the ones that are visible. The description *must* be unambiguous.

6.  **Choosing the Best Phrase:** Okay, I'm weighing my options. ""The triangle"" is the most concise. ""The object with vertical stripes"" is also good, since it's unique. Combining features, like ""The blue triangle with vertical stripes,"" adds clarity, but is maybe a bit redundant. I'll summarize it and analyze the properties and distractor objects again: Triangle, with vertical stripes, and a blue border. The other objects: Square with a green border, square with a red border, star with a blue border, and a circle with a green border. I am focusing on what separates the target from all of the other objects.

    Here are the descriptions again:
    *   ""The triangle""
    *   ""The one with vertical stripes""
    *   ""The blue triangle""
    *   ""The blue object with vertical stripes.""
    *   ""The triangle with vertical stripes.""

    Considering the goal, it is important to be helpful. Thus, I want to use slightly more information to give a clear and intuitive response. Based on the fact that only the target has vertical stripes, I will focus on this feature.

    Now, I'm re-evaluating. *Shape* – triangle, *Fill* – vertical stripes, *Border Color* - Blue.

    Which is better? ""The triangle"" or ""the one with vertical stripes""? Both are unambiguous. I will attempt to make it slightly more descriptive, without being verbose.

    So, I'm thinking, ""The blue object with vertical stripes"" to show the distinct fill pattern. ""The triangle with vertical stripes"" focuses on all of its unique properties. The fill is very distinct. Thus, ""The object that is filled with vertical stripes"" is a helpful description.

    Based on the objects, the most salient property is the fill pattern. Vertical stripes are the most salient, as the other objects are wavy. This makes that the best discriminator.

    *   Final description: **""The object filled with vertical stripes.""**
"
exp2_009.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,circle,red,wavy,"1,1",The circle with the wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with a reference game. My goal is to describe a specific object in an image so another person can pick it out. Let's break this down systematically.

First, I need to analyze the visual scene. I see a 3x2 grid with four visible and two hidden objects. The target is in the top-left, clearly marked with a red dashed box. It's a circle. I can see a circle with a red border, filled with a grey and white wavy pattern. There's another circle in the bottom-right that is a distractor. It has a thick black border and a grey polka dot pattern on a white background. The other grid cells are obscured by red curtains with white question marks.

Next, I have to pinpoint the target. It's that circle in the top-left cell. Now, what makes this circle unique? It has a red border and this interesting grey and white wavy pattern inside. I need to keep in mind the potential for unseen elements.

I need to quickly analyze the main distractor in the bottom right, it has a black border and a dotted pattern. So now, I'm identifying the key features. It's a circle, but so is the distractor, so that's not enough to be unique. Red border versus black border? That's good. Wavy pattern versus polka dots? Also excellent. Grey and white colors are also helpful, but probably less critical if the pattern is distinctive enough.

So, how do I phrase this concisely and effectively? I want to avoid ambiguity. I need to create a simple description. My first thought is: ""It's the circle with the red border."" That's simple, but what if there's a red border hiding behind one of those curtains? That could be a problem. What about ""It's the circle with the wavy grey and white pattern?"" That's very specific, but maybe a bit wordy. Combining them is better: ""It's the circle with the red border and a wavy pattern inside."" Now I'm considering alternatives: ""The object with squiggly lines."" ""The object with the red circle around it."" Trying to be precise, but still not overly long. ""The circle with the squiggly pattern."" ""The circle with the red outline.""

I have to carefully evaluate the possible descriptions. Here's a comparison:
* Target: Red border, wavy pattern.
* Distractor: Black border, dotted pattern.

Both features, the border color and pattern type, seem sufficient. Should I use one or both? Using both seems safest. But the pattern is more visually central. ""The circle filled with a wavy pattern."" This directly contrasts with the dotted pattern. It's clear and concise.

I'm starting to think about hidden objects. What if a hidden object is a circle with a blue border? Then ""the circle with the red border"" is still best. If it's a square with a red border, the same logic applies. If it's a circle with a red border and stripes, I'd need the full description: ""the circle with the red border and a wavy pattern."" I can't be sure, so being as specific as possible without being too verbose is the aim. Should I combine border and pattern? However, the instructions favor simple. The biggest visual difference between the two circles? Pattern! Wavy vs. dots.

So, I will settle with the pattern. ""It's the circle filled with a wavy pattern."" That directly contrasts with the dotted circle. I'm going to quickly try another approach. ""There are two circles with patterns. One has dots, the other has wavy lines. I mean the one with the wavy lines."" Too conversational. I need to be direct. ""The circle with the grey and white squiggly lines."" Let's try to be even more concise. ""The circle with the wavy pattern."" Do I need the colors? Probably not if the pattern itself is unique.

Okay, let's nail this. I'll focus on the most visually prominent thing: the wavy pattern. So I will go with: ""The circle with the wavy pattern inside."" It's simple, to the point, and it quickly separates it from the dotted circle. That's my final choice.
"
exp2_010.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,square,red,stripe,"3,2",The object is a square with a red border that is filled with vertical grey and white stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My goal is to describe a target object in an image so someone else can identify it. I need to be precise, but also efficient. I'm presented with a 3x3 grid. I can see certain objects, and the other person can also see things (but not what I can see).

First, I need to *really* analyze the visual elements. The target is a square in the middle-right cell. It has a red border and vertical grey and white stripes inside. To compare, I see a red-bordered circle filled with grey dots in the top-left, and two red curtains with white question marks in the middle-left and top-middle. The rest is white emptiness.

Next, I have to figure out the key features to focus on. Shape is important: The target is a *square*. This immediately distinguishes it from the circular dot-filled object. The borders might matter, too. The circle and the target have red borders, but the curtain squares don't have distinct borders in the same way. But really, the *pattern* is the most distinctive. The vertical stripes set it apart from the dots and the curtains.

Now, how do I phrase this description? I want to avoid ambiguity. I need to be certain that the other person can pick it out, even if they can also see behind the curtains. I'm focusing on features I can directly observe. ""The square with vertical stripes"" is a good starting point. Simple, direct. I could add ""filled with grey and white stripes"" or even ""inside a red border"" to add a bit of extra detail.

Let's consider possible pitfalls. What if one of those hidden squares *also* has vertical stripes? The rules say the other person has this information. But my description must be based on my viewpoint. The most *salient* visible object matching ""vertical stripes"" is the target. The listener's job is to match the description. Adding the color (grey and white) or border detail could strengthen it.

I'm thinking: ""The square filled with vertical stripes."" The listener will see ""square"" and ""vertical stripes"" and they'll distinguish this from the circle with the dots, and the curtains. The shape and the pattern should make this clear. The best answer simplifies while also communicating the critical information. I'm satisfied.
"
exp2_011.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,square,black,wavy,"1,3",The square with the wavy gray and white pattern and a black border.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My task is to describe this object so someone else can pick it out from the grid. Let's break this down. First, I need to understand the visual field. There's a 3x3 grid, some empty spaces, and four visible objects, including the target.

I can see where the target is: the bottom-left square. It has a wavy, grey and white pattern and a black border. I need to focus on what makes *this* object different. There's another visible object with a grey and white striped pattern and a green border. And there are two other objects hidden behind red curtains with white question marks. I can't *see* the curtains, but they are there! I should not rely on the fact that I can see the dashed red lines.

So, I need to find the right words. I want my description to be unambiguous. If I'm too vague, the listener could pick the wrong object. But, if I'm too detailed, it'll be too complex.

The key features are the wavy pattern and the black border. The other visible object has stripes and a green border. I should use them. The pattern of the target is very distinct from the stripes, so that seems like the safest bet. What would be the best way to combine them? ""The square with the wavy pattern inside a black frame."" is one idea. Or I could say, ""The object with the black border and a wavy pattern.""

I could just say, ""The square with the wavy pattern."" This is simple and effective. It's the most prominent feature. Then I think about the border color. Is it a good distinguishing attribute? ""The object with the black border."" This is too short, I think. I may need to make it more complex to distinguish it from the objects that I can't see!

Let's try: ""The object with a wavy pattern and a black border.""

I can describe the pattern as ""squiggly lines"" too. Let's try to focus on the comparison.

Okay, let's keep it concise, but specific. Focusing on *just* the pattern, ""The object with the wavy pattern,"" seems like a decent start. But for safety, I'll add the black border. Let's describe the most visually obvious part. ""The square with the wavy gray and white pattern, inside a black border."" That is a little long. Let's try shorter: ""The object with the black border and wavy pattern.""

Let's go back to basics. How about ""The square with the black border?"" That is too simple. The other visible square has a green border. Maybe they are too similar.

Then, ""The square with the wavy pattern."" That feels more promising, it's distinctive.

Ultimately, I will choose, ""The square with the wavy pattern and a black border.""
"
exp2_012.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,triangle,black,wavy,"2,3",Select the triangle with the wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the goal is to describe a specific object on this grid so another person can pick it out. I need to be precise and avoid ambiguity. Let's break it down.

First, I analyze the target. It's a triangle with a thick black outline, filled with a grey and white wavy line pattern. It's in the bottom middle cell of a 3x3 grid. I also see other shapes: a circle with red outline and a polka dot fill; a circle with green outline and a polka dot fill; another circle with a red outline and vertical stripes. There's also a star that shares the same wavy pattern and black outline as the target, but is obviously a different shape. The rest of the grid is empty. Importantly, there are *no* hidden objects in this instance, though the prompt hints at the possibility.

Now, I'm thinking about how to describe it. ""The triangle with the wavy lines"" *should* work, right? The shape is unique in this array, that's the key. But I need to consider potential ambiguities. If I just say ""the object with wavy lines,"" that's no good, because the star also has the wavy pattern. Same with ""the black outline"".

So, the simplest and most robust is, ""The triangle."" Boom. Concise, unambiguous. The other person *should* be able to pick it out immediately. But the prompt mentions hidden objects and different arrangements. So, I need to consider if there might be hidden objects that are also triangles. In this example, there are *no* hidden objects, but the rules of the game might change.

I could be more descriptive. ""The triangle with the wavy pattern inside."" Now I'm adding a bit more detail, just in case there's any confusion. ""The triangle"" seems like a powerful descriptor; the shape is unique. Thinking about the prompt's warning about potentially hidden objects, I should probably be a bit more robust.

I'm evaluating whether ""the triangle with wavy lines"" is sufficient. I think so, because, as it stands, there is only one triangle. So, it's robust. The star is a distractor, but not a triangle. The shape is the most unique descriptor. But if the other person rearranged the pattern, will this description be useless? Hmm. Perhaps not.

My final choice is: ""It's the triangle with the wavy pattern."" This is a solid description. It's concise. It mentions the salient and unique shape. It's also somewhat descriptive. I could say ""Select the triangle"" but this version is more precise. That should work, no matter how the other person rearranges the objects or if one is hidden. This should cover any contingency.

exp2_013.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,2,square,red,dot,"3,2",Select the square that is filled with grey dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to guide the listener to select a specific object within a 3x3 grid. The prompt provides an image, and I need to craft a precise description of the target, the square filled with grey dots in the middle-right cell. I need to make the listener select the correct object.

First, I meticulously analyze the image. I see a 3x3 grid, and three objects are visible (ignoring the empty cells). I identify the target object – a square with a red border and an interior filled with a grid of grey dots. My primary task is to clearly differentiate this object from the other two distractors: a red-bordered circle with a checkerboard pattern, and a black-bordered square, also with a checkerboard pattern.

I quickly rule out relying on spatial locations like ""the one on the right"" or ""in the middle"" as the rules prohibit that. The prompt mentions ""red curtains"" (hidden objects), which reminds me that I need to be as descriptive as possible. I want to convey sufficient information about the visible features of the target object.

I consider several possible descriptions: focusing on the pattern (""grey dots""), shape and pattern (""square filled with grey dots""), and border and pattern (""red border and grey dots""). My constraint checklist gives me a confidence score of 5/5, suggesting that the initial analysis is sound.

I then move into a ""mental sandbox"" to refine my wording, testing and iterating on potential utterances. I begin with the simplest descriptor: ""Select the object filled with grey dots."" This seems strong, as the grey dots are a unique feature among the visible objects. Next, I add shape: ""Select the square filled with grey dots."" Although there is another square, adding this information doesn't hurt. I also consider the border: ""Select the object with a red border and a pattern of grey dots.""

Comparing the attempts, I notice that the ""grey dots"" pattern is the most concise feature to differentiate the target from the distractors. The shape, ""square"", is shared with another object but the dot pattern is unique.

I formally summarize the features of the target and the distractors in a table. I confirm that the ""grey dots"" pattern is a crucial differentiator.

I begin constructing the final utterance, aiming for clarity and precision. I explore phrases like ""the object filled with a pattern of grey dots,"" ""the square that's filled with grey dots,"" and ""the object that has grey dots in it."" I need to consider what if there are *hidden* objects. The phrasing ""the square filled with grey dots"" is safer. Adding the ""red border"" would improve it if there's a hidden object with grey dots and a blue border.

I conclude that a more robust description should incorporate multiple features: shape (""square""), pattern (""grey dots""), and even border (""red"").

I synthesize multiple combinations and arrive at the most concise and effective description, based on the principle of distinguishing the target with multiple unique features, combining the following elements: ""square"", ""grey dots"". After several attempts, the best and most robust final utterance is: ""The square that is filled with grey dots."" This description is concise, accurate, and differentiates the target object from both visible distractors. This also accounts for hidden objects.

exp2_014.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,star,red,checker,"3,2",Select the star that is filled with a checkerboard pattern.,"**My Thought Process: Deciding on the Best Description**

Okay, the task is to act as a speaker in a reference game, and I need to describe a target object (highlighted by a red dashed box). I'm looking at a 3x3 grid with five visible objects. My objective is to formulate a clear, unambiguous instruction to identify the target: a star with a red outline and a checkerboard pattern filling its interior.

First, I analyze the image. I see a grey wavy circle, a grey and white checkerboard square, the target (the red star with the checkerboard fill), a vertical striped green triangle, and a striped black star. I need to single out the red, checkerboard star.

I consider differentiating features. Shape (star), outline color (red), and fill pattern (checkerboard). The key is distinguishing it from the *other* objects. ""The star"" is insufficient because there's another. ""The red star"" works, as there's only one red object. ""The star with the checkerboard pattern"" also works, as there's only one star with that specific pattern, and the checkerboard square and star each have a distinct fill.

I begin comparing the target object with the other objects in the grid. ""The red star"" is unique. ""The star with the checkerboard pattern"" is unique. Since there are no other red objects, ""the red object"" is also unique. I'll need to choose the best option from these.

I develop some candidate descriptions, focusing on simplicity and precision. ""Select the star with the red outline"" is good. ""Select the star that is filled with a checkerboard pattern"" is also accurate. ""Select the object that has a red outline and a checkerboard fill"" is detailed, but potentially more verbose than necessary.

I then consider which features are most salient. The color ""red"" is a strong cue. The combination of color and shape (""the red star"") is especially specific. I consider the fill pattern, realizing ""the checkerboard object"" is ambiguous as there's a checkerboard square. I need to be exact, so ""the star with the checkerboard pattern"" or ""the checkerboard star"" works.

I go through more options. I'm focusing on ""the red star"" (concise and effective) and ""the star with the checkerboard pattern"" (highlights pattern and shape). The instructions do not mention colorblindness, so I don't have to account for that.

Then I double-check uniqueness: ""the red star"", ""the star with the checkerboard pattern"" and ""the object with the red outline"" all work.

I then formulate ""The star that is filled with a checkerboard pattern."" I try to make it even more natural: ""The object I'm thinking of is a star filled with a checkerboard pattern."" Finally, I go back to ""The star with the checkerboard pattern"" as it clearly and concisely states the two key distinguishing features.

I believe ""Select the star that has a checkerboard pattern inside"" or ""The star with the checkerboard pattern"" is the best option because it hits the important attributes, and no other objects match these features.

exp2_015.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,triangle,green,dot,"3,2",The triangle with the green outline is filled with gray dots.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to guide the listener to the specific target object using only words, avoiding any visual cues that I wouldn't provide in a normal conversation. I need to be precise, but also efficient in my description.

First, I quickly analyzed the visual layout. It's a partially visible 3x3 grid, effectively a 3x2 grid given what I can see. I've got four objects in view: two red curtains, one green triangle with gray dots (the target!), and one blue triangle with a checkerboard pattern. The empty cells are important to note because a description could reference relative location.

My brain automatically moves to identification of the target. It's the green triangle filled with gray dots, prominently located in the middle-right cell, highlighted for good measure. I then need to identify the distractors (the other objects) which I already see: the pair of red curtains with question marks and the blue-bordered triangle.

Now, I'm already formulating how to describe the target. My approach is to zero in on what makes the target unique. I consider that the listener doesn't know what's behind the curtains, so I need to focus on what *I* can see, so I'll prioritize describing the visible, non-curtain objects first.

The target’s most striking features are its shape (a triangle), its border color (green), and its internal pattern (gray dots). The other triangle is my key point of contrast. Green and dots versus blue and checkerboard. This is the crux of my strategy.

I began to craft and mentally test different descriptions. ""The target is a triangle"" is too generic because of the other triangle. ""The target is the green triangle"" is better, but maybe it's too risky. ""The target is the triangle filled with dots"" is also workable. I then formulated the most robust description, ""The target is the triangle with a green border and filled with gray dots.""

I immediately questioned the robustness of that description. I have no information on the hidden items. There might be another green triangle hidden behind one of the curtains. The safest way to be sure is to include *both* the border color *and* the fill pattern. That way, there’s less of a chance of a hidden object matching both features exactly.

So I've refined my description further, aiming for clarity and conciseness, without compromising precision. I went through several iterations mentally: ""Select the triangle that has a green outline and is filled with grey dots,"" ""It's the triangle with the green border and the polka dot pattern,"" and, more concisely, ""The green triangle with dots.""

I concluded that the most effective and safe description would be, ""The triangle with the green outline is filled with gray dots."" This highlights *both* key features – the green border and the gray dot fill – and contrasts well with the blue-bordered, checkerboard triangle. It's also simple and precise, which are key for effective communication in this kind of reference task. I'm going with that.
"
exp2_016.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,square,green,dot,"2,3",The object is a square with polka dots inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game and need to describe an object, the ""target,"" in a way that allows someone to identify it. First, I need to analyze the scene. There's a 3x3 grid, and I can see three objects: a blue-bordered circle with a wavy pattern, a red-bordered circle with polka dots, and then the target: a square with a green border and polka dots. A red dashed box highlights the target. I need to make sure my description is clear, even though the listener might have a different perspective on the grid. Importantly, there might also be hidden objects behind a curtain that I can't see, so my description needs to be robust to those.

First, I identified the target's characteristics: a square shape, a green border, and a polka-dot pattern. I also noted the distractors and their features. I started to formulate descriptions based on these features. I realized the shape is a very salient feature because no other visible object is a square. So I considered ""the square,"" or ""the green object."" But I knew, I also needed to account for the possibility of hidden objects, I needed to make my description specific.

Now, my process becomes more complicated. I started by weighing different combinations of features. ""The green square"" is concise and combines the shape and color but could be ambiguous if there are other green squares hidden. ""The square with polka dots"" uses shape and pattern. I needed to consider that the red circle also has the polka dot pattern. Using ""The object with polka dots"" alone wouldn't be enough. The object needs to be specific!

I needed to be able to distinguish the target from any other object, whether visible or hidden, so I needed to consider a *combination* of features. So what combinations are most robust?

I wanted a robust description, so I weighed various options. ""The green square"" seemed strong. It uses two distinct features, and it is fairly short. ""The square with polka dots"" also seemed viable. But, ""the square with the green border and polka dots"" is the most complete description, but might be too long for a game. I decided to go with ""The square with polka dots inside,"" as it combines the primary shape with the shared pattern. The other object with polka dots is a circle, which avoids ambiguity. I also considered ""the green square,"" which might be the best option overall.

Ultimately, I want to use the simplest feature combination that uniquely identifies the target. ""The square"" is a good start, ""The green object"" is a good start. I decided on ""The square with polka dots inside,"" I believe this description is the most concise while avoiding any ambiguity given the visible objects. ""The green square"" is also very clear, as is ""The square with the green border"" I need to decide, but this should be my choice.
"
exp2_017.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,4,star,green,stripe,"2,3",The object is a green star filled with vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My goal is to describe a target object in an image so that another person can select it. Let's break this down.

First, I need to *understand* the image. It's a grid, but not a straightforward one. I see a 3x2 grid with some merged cells. There's a red curtain with question marks, a striped circle, a polka-dot square, a wavy-lined square, and most importantly, the target: a green star filled with vertical stripes.

My approach here must be effective. I need to zero in on what makes the green star *uniquely identifiable*.

I see the green star and immediately note its key features: the green outline, the shape (a star), and the vertical stripes within. This is where I start building a description, and my strategy will involve three aspects: shape, color, and fill-pattern, and how these aspects might make an effective description.

The immediate challenge? There's a striped circle! So, I can't just say, ""the striped object"". I need to be *precise*. ""The green object"" is also good, but let's go with, the shape, the green outline and the pattern. Let's see if this description is *unambiguous* among the visible objects.

Now I think about the most salient features. Shape is very distinct (a star). Color is also unique (green), but there are similar features, and so it might not be enough. The combination should be robust: the ""green star"" seems ideal. But, how do I make it more precise? By adding the fill pattern: ""The green star is filled with vertical stripes.""

So, I check to see if the distractor objects are present, and whether I can clarify this description by comparison. There's a circle and a star both filled with stripes. I can also formulate a description that helps: ""There's a circle with vertical stripes and a star with vertical stripes. I want the star."" This is very clear.

My final decision will need to be concise and accurate. I'm going for ""The green star with vertical stripes inside,"" because this mentions shape, color and fill. It's direct, it's unambiguous, and it should be easy to identify from other objects in the image. I believe this description provides enough to correctly pick the target object.

exp2_018.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,star,blue,dot,"1,1",Select the star with the blue outline that has grey dots inside it.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to guide the other person in identifying the target object. It's enclosed in a red dashed box, a visual cue for me to focus on. My thinking goes something like this:

First, the obvious: I need to *identify* the object. It's a five-pointed star. Now, the real work begins – analyzing its features to craft a distinguishing description.

I break it down: *shape* – it's a star; *color* – specifically, a blue *outline*, with a white interior speckled with a grey dot pattern; *size* – it's relatively large within its cell, but I need to avoid using location-based descriptors; *location* – Top-left cell, but no, I cannot use location.

Next, I have to analyze the distractors – the other visible objects. There’s a square object with a blue border and wavy lines, easily distinguishable. Then, there are those tempting red curtains concealing unknown elements, with white question marks. Ah, that's where the difficulty lies. I have to be as specific as possible, as what might be hidden behind could be another star. My biggest challenge.

So, how do I formulate the description? I start with the most obvious attribute: ""It's a star."" Then, I add the distinguishing details: ""It has a blue outline."" Now to differentiate, I need to make my description specific: ""The inside of the star is white with grey dots.""

Refining the description is key. I need to get this right. I quickly consolidate and try out a concise instruction: ""Select the star with the blue outline that has grey dots inside it."" Is this enough? I need to think about the potential hidden elements behind the curtains. What if there's another star behind a curtain? The crucial part is to describe the features that make it unique. It's all about making my description *unique*.

I’m picturing potential stars: a solid red star, a star with stripes. I have to create a description that differentiates against all possibilities. ""Star,"" ""blue outline,"" ""grey dots inside."" The square is an easily ruled out distractor.

I need to nail this. I consider a more precise version: ""The five-pointed star with a blue outline and a pattern of grey dots inside."" But this might be too much.

So, considering precision and conciseness, I settle on: ""The star with the blue outline and grey dots inside."" This should be sufficient to identify the target and rule out the distractors, including anything hidden behind the curtains. It encompasses the key visual elements.
"
exp2_019.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,triangle,red,dot,"2,1",The triangle that is filled with dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My goal is to describe a target object in this 3x3 grid so that another person can select it correctly. I'm focusing on the current scene, which has four objects visible. I need to make sure my description will let them identify the specific red-outlined triangle filled with gray dots.

First, I take a look at the scene. I see the target triangle, the other triangle with the blue outline and wavy lines, and the two red curtains with question marks. I have to think about what's *not* visible, because the other person knows what's behind the curtains.

The target is the red-outlined triangle with gray dots. It's in the top row, second column. The distractor is the blue-outlined triangle with wavy lines. The curtains are a distraction, because the other person knows what's behind them. There may be hidden triangles, so I must be careful.

I need a description that distinguishes the target. The outline color, fill pattern, and outline style are the key features to differentiate it from the other visible triangle. I need to formulate a good description, trying to keep it clear.

Initially, I think of ""the triangle with the red outline."" That would be a simple start. Or, ""the triangle filled with dots,"" as the other has wavy lines. Or ""the red triangle with dots inside,"" combining features.

But, I realize, there's a risk of ambiguity. What if there's another red triangle or one with dots behind the curtains? I need a description that is unique among all of the objects, not just the currently visible ones.

So, I refine the approach. I want to use the features that are most clear and make it unique among both the visible *and* hidden objects. Let's compare the key features: the red outline versus the blue one, and the dots vs. the wavy lines. Describing the fill pattern seems really strong, as ""dots"" versus ""wavy lines"" is a distinct visual difference.

I start to formulate descriptions. Combining features helps to reduce ambiguity. I think ""The triangle with the red outline and it's filled with gray dots"" seems clear. The other options are ""The triangle with the red outline and gray dots inside,"" or a shorter ""The red triangle filled with dots."" I aim for clarity but also want to be concise. The most prominent feature is the fill pattern.

I consider simpler descriptions. ""The triangle filled with dots"" is effective. While it is possible there may be another triangle with dots behind a curtain, it's less likely than there being another ""red"" object. Perhaps the best description is ""The triangle with the red outline and dots inside.""

Comparing the features, the fill pattern is very distinct. Both ""The triangle filled with dots"" and ""The triangle with a red outline"" are good descriptions. But is one better? The color ""red"" is also on the curtains, so describing the fill pattern is probably slightly better, given what I know about the full scene. I want to minimize chances for error.

So, I think about phrasing. ""Select the triangle that is filled with dots."" Or ""The triangle with dots inside."" I want to be natural and concise, with a small risk of being too brief, so I'll go with a slightly more descriptive option to be safe. ""The triangle with the red outline and dots inside."" This should address all of the possibilities.

Okay, let's simplify again. I want to be concise. The fill is very clear. Target fill: dots. Distractor fill: wavy lines. It's a clear distinction. And also the outline. Target outline: red. Distractor outline: blue. This is also a clear distinction.

""The triangle with dots"" and ""The triangle with a red outline"" are both good. But since ""red"" is also in the curtains, the dots are best. The pattern is unique and less likely to be ambiguous, so I stick with the fill pattern. I choose ""The triangle that is filled with dots.""
"
exp2_020.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,triangle,black,dot,"1,1",The triangle with dots inside.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I need to describe an object in this reference game. The goal is to make sure someone else can pick it out from the other objects. The target is in the top-left cell, and I immediately analyze it: it's a triangle with a thick black outline, and inside, it's filled with a pattern of grey dots on a white background.

Now, I look around. I see other shapes. There's a square in the top-middle, filled with wavy lines, and another triangle in the bottom-left with vertical stripes. There are also two red curtains with question marks; those are hidden objects.

The key is to formulate a description that uniquely identifies the target. I notice there are *two* triangles. The location ""top-left"" feels somewhat redundant, and I'd prefer not to use it. The core difference is the fill pattern! One has dots, the other stripes. That's the differentiator. The square won't cause any confusion.

I start formulating descriptions. ""The triangle filled with dots"" is clear. I refine it. ""It's a triangle with dots inside"" is simple and effective. ""The object is a triangle with a polka dot pattern"" is another way to phrase it, but I want to keep it straightforward. ""Select the triangle that has grey dots inside it"" is extremely unambiguous, but possibly longer than I need.

My mind then wanders into potential ambiguities. What if, behind one of those curtains, there's *another* triangle with dots? I can't know that based on what I can see. I'm operating on the information available to me. The listener knows what's hidden; they'll ask if necessary. But, given my current view, ""the triangle with dots"" is the only unambiguous choice.

So, I choose to keep it concise and clear. The most crucial feature is the interior pattern. I think ""The triangle with dots inside."" will be perfect.
"
exp2_021.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,triangle,red,stripe,"1,2",The object that is a triangle and has vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the goal is clear: I need to describe this object so someone can pick it out from the grid. I'm focusing on providing a unique and unambiguous description. The grid is a 3x3 array; some cells are occupied, some are empty. I've got a dashed red box around the target; it's a triangle.

I'll start by analyzing the image and identifying all the objects. I see a circle, a star, and the target triangle. Each has a distinct outline color and internal pattern. My target is the triangle. I note the properties: a red outline and grey vertical stripes.

Now, let's consider the distractors. The key here is to identify what *differentiates* the target. The circle is a blue-outlined, checkerboard-patterned object. The green star has polka dots. These are easy to eliminate. The real challenge is the other star: it also has red outline and vertical stripes. The shape is the main differentiator.

The instruction says to avoid using degenerate spatial locations, so I can't say ""the one in the middle left."" My strategy is to find a description that's both efficient and unambiguous.

First, I think ""the triangle"" would be enough. But to be extra clear I could say, ""the triangle with vertical stripes."" and ""the red triangle"". Combining this to ""the red triangle with vertical stripes"" to ensure uniqueness is also good, but maybe a little too verbose.

The ""vertical stripes"" pattern is shared with a star, so I must mention the shape, so I will go with ""The object that is a triangle and has vertical stripes."" or ""The vertically striped triangle."". These should work.

Let me break it down one more time. The shape ""triangle"" is unique. Since there are no other triangles, ""the triangle"" is sufficient and minimal. To be safe, adding another feature, such as the pattern, or color, would not hurt.

Looking at the scene again and keeping it as simple as possible but still being unambiguous, ""The triangle"" works as a simple unique description, so does ""The triangle with the red border."" Considering ""clear communication"" and possible misperception, I believe that being minimally redundant is a better strategy than using a minimalistic description. I will go with ""The triangle with the vertical stripes."". This uses the shape (unique) and the pattern (shared with the most similar distractor), it's a good balance of being informative and concise. It makes sure that the most salient feature is specified.

The final choice: ""The triangle with the vertical stripes.""
"
exp2_022.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,square,black,stripe,"3,1",The square with vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the goal is to describe a specific object in a grid so that someone else can pick it out, and I can't see everything they see. I need to be precise and avoid ambiguity. Let's break this down. First, I need to *thoroughly* analyze the target object. It's a square. The outline is black and thick, and the fill is vertical grey stripes. It's in the top right, but I *cannot* use that location. I *also* can't describe the red box around it, because that's only visible to me.

Next, I need to look at what *else* is on the screen, the distractors. There's a red-outlined, checkered star; a black-outlined circle with vertical stripes; a red-outlined circle with vertical stripes; and a blue-outlined polka-dot star. There are also empty cells and potentially hidden objects, though not in this specific instance. I need to keep that in mind when formulating my description.

My task is to find a unique description. Being a square is a strong feature, as there are no other squares. But two other objects have the vertical grey stripes, so saying ""vertical stripes"" alone is not enough. The black outline also isn't enough, since there is another object with a black outline.

So, how can I combine these properties to make a description that works? I could say ""the square,"" but I can't be sure if there is another square visible to the listener. So, I will try a fuller description. ""The square with vertical stripes"" could be good, as it provides a very distinct feature. I could also say, ""The black-outlined square"".

Now, I need to evaluate these descriptions. The best description should be concise and unambiguous. ""The square"" is the most concise in *this* context, but it isn't robust enough. However, ""The square with vertical stripes"" is also good, since it adds more detail, which is helpful to confirm the selection. ""The black-outlined square"" is also good.

Okay, let's think about potential issues for the listener. The listener can see the same objects but potentially in a different arrangement. I *cannot* rely on location. Could there be other objects I can't see? I need a robust description.

Let me re-evaluate, considering the distractors. The target is a square, with a black outline and vertical stripes. I need to distinguish it from the other objects. The black-outlined, vertically striped circle is the most similar object. The only difference is the shape! The shape *must* be included. Adding the color is a nice extra detail. The other objects are easily distinguished by outline or fill.

I've got it: ""The square with vertical stripes"" is a good description. Is there any other square with vertical stripes? No. Are there other objects with vertical stripes? Yes, two circles. But they're not squares! This description is unique.

Okay, I need to make a final decision, a concise description. The shape is the most critical feature. The fill pattern helps distinguish it from the other objects. I will try another combination: ""the black-outlined shape with vertical stripes that is not a circle."" This is too complicated!

Let's stick to positive attributes.

Combinations:

*   ""The square"" - might be ambiguous if there's another square I can't see.
*   ""The object with vertical stripes and a black outline"" - Ambiguous, matches the circle too.
*   ""The square with vertical stripes"" - Unambiguous.
*   ""The square with a black outline"" - Unambiguous.

Both ""The square with vertical stripes"" and ""The square with a black outline"" work well. Let's go with the fill pattern as it's a more prominent visual feature than the outline color. I need to be the ""speaker"". The output should be the description itself.

So, I will output: **""The square with vertical stripes.""**
It's clear, concise, and uniquely identifies the target object among the distractors.

exp2_023.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,circle,green,dot,"3,2",Select the circle that is filled with grey dots.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I need to act as a speaker in this reference game and guide someone to select the correct object. The target is indicated by a red dashed box. My process starts with a careful analysis of the object itself. I see a circle, with a green outline, and a fill pattern of grey dots on a white background.

Next, I need to consider the surrounding ""distractors,"" the other objects in the selection pool. I'm noting the top-left triangle (thick black outline, dotted fill), the top-center square (same black outline, same dotted fill), the top-right circle (blue outline, checkerboard fill), and the bottom-left star (green outline, dotted fill). Ignoring any empty cells or hidden objects for now.

Now, it's time to form a description. I could just start by saying, ""It's a circle,"" but that's not enough to pinpoint the specific object. The same goes for saying ""it's filled with grey dots."" That describes too many objects. ""It's a green object"" isn't specific enough either. I need to get more precise. The blue outline on the other circle provides a strong distinction. The checkerboard pattern on the other circle is a key feature that needs to be considered.

I start to combine the properties. ""It's a circle and it has a green outline"" This works as the other circle is blue, but so does ""It's a circle and it is filled with grey dots."" This is unique.

I consider refinement. I analyze the properties of each distractor to ensure my description is unambiguous. The key is to narrow down the possible targets. I try, ""The circle with the green outline."" but realize a star also has a green outline. ""The circle filled with grey dots."" This works, as nothing else is both a circle and filled with grey dots.

Ultimately, ""Select the circle that is filled with grey dots"" is the best because it is simple and directly contrasts the checkerboard fill of the other circle, making the instruction clear and unambiguous. While ""The circle with the green outline"" is equally valid, I will go with ""the circle filled with grey dots"" as the key distinction.

exp2_024.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,2,triangle,green,stripe,"1,2",The triangle with the green outline.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object within this 3x3 grid so that a listener can identify it. I need to be precise and avoid ambiguity. Let's break down my strategy.

First, I need to analyze the visual data. I see a 3x3 grid, and there are three objects displayed. The target, which is indicated by the dashed red box, is a triangle with a green outline and vertical grey stripes. The other objects are a circle with a green outline and a wavy grey pattern, and another triangle with a black outline and a polka dot grey pattern. The other cells are empty.

My first thought is to zero in on the unique features of the target object. It's the triangle in the middle-left cell with the green outline and vertical stripes.

Next, I have to consider the distractors. The circle shares the green outline with the target, but not the shape or pattern. The other triangle shares the shape, but not the outline color or pattern.

To generate a useful description, I have to think about the features that distinguish the target from the distractors. Position alone is a poor choice, because it is not always consistent. The red curtain note is not applicable here. So, it's shape, outline color, and inner pattern that are salient.

I need to compare and contrast. ""The triangle"" isn't enough as there are two triangles. ""The green outline"" is not enough because the circle has a green outline, too. ""The vertical stripes"" is enough because the other objects don't have that pattern.

""The triangle with the green outline"" could work. The other triangle has a black outline. The other green object is a circle. This is unambiguous, and it contrasts with both of the distractors. It also has a good signal to noise ratio.

""The triangle with vertical stripes"" could also work, as there's no other object with that pattern. The dot pattern on the other triangle and the wavy pattern on the circle are distinct.

I consider the relative merits of the candidate descriptions. ""The triangle with the green outline"" works by contrasting color and shape with the other objects. The other triangle is a black triangle, and the other green object is a circle. ""The triangle with vertical stripes"" works by contrasting the pattern with the distractors. No other object has those features. Conciseness is a factor, but clarity is paramount, especially since this is an image.

I do a mental check: ""The triangle with the green outline."" Is there another triangle with the same outline? No. Does any other object look similar? No. Perfect. ""The triangle with vertical stripes"". Does it also work? Yes. Perfect. This could be my preferred choice.

Let's try ""The green triangle."" This is concise, but does it work? Is there another green triangle? No. The other triangle has a black outline. The other green object is a circle. This works, too!

I'm leaning toward combining the features for maximum clarity. ""The triangle with a green outline and vertical stripes inside"" is good, but long. A more concise version would be better. ""The green triangle"" also works. ""The triangle with the green outline"" is also good and slightly more descriptive. ""The triangle with vertical stripes"" works as well.

Because color tends to be a salient visual feature, I'm choosing ""The triangle with the green outline."" It’s unambiguous, efficient, and successfully distinguishes the target from the distractors. It is easy to use, and easy to understand.

exp2_025.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,star,blue,dot,"1,3",It's the star with a blue outline that is filled with grey dots.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. The goal is to get the listener to pick out a specific object from a set, without actually showing it to them. Let's see... the user has given me an image and a set of instructions.

First, I need to understand what I'm looking at. It's a 3x3 grid. Some cells are empty, some have visible objects, and a couple are hidden behind a curtain. The target, indicated by the red dashed box, is a blue-outlined star filled with a grey dotted pattern. The other visible object, the distractor, is a checkerboard pattern with a blue border. There are also hidden objects behind the curtain, which I can't see, but the listener can.

My immediate job is to describe the target object so the listener can identify it correctly. I need to be precise and unambiguous. First, I identify the target and consider its characteristics: it's a star, it has a blue outline, and its interior is filled with tiny grey dots.

Next, I think about potential ambiguity. It has a blue outline just like the checkerboard. I need to make the description very specific. The best description should focus on the unique visual properties of the star.

I'm thinking, I should start with the shape (""star""), then add the outline color (""blue outline""), and then the fill pattern (""grey dots""). Combining these features seems robust enough. I'll need to make sure I don't use any spatial language that might depend on the object's position in the grid. My final description should be based purely on the object's visual characteristics.

Then, I'm forming a few descriptions in my head to see what works best. Should I just say ""Select the star with a blue outline that is filled with grey dots"" or ""It's the star with the blue outline and grey dots inside"" or maybe just ""There's a star with a blue outline, and the inside is filled with grey dots""? I need to avoid ambiguity and be as clear and concise as possible.

I've got it. I'll go with the description: ""It's the star with the blue outline and grey dots inside."" That's simple, direct, and should be clear enough to distinguish the target object from the others in the game, even the hidden ones.
"
exp2_026.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,star,black,checker,"1,1",It's a star with a checkerboard pattern inside.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to help the listener identify a specific object within a visual array. It's in a red dashed box, so I know I need to be precise.

First, I need to understand what I'm looking at. Let me break down the target: it's a five-pointed star with a thick, black outline. Inside, it has a checkerboard pattern composed of grey and white squares. It sits in a white grid cell. Got it.

Next, I have to analyze the context. I see another star in the bottom left; it also has a thick, black outline but its internal pattern consists of grey and white vertical stripes. There are also two cells that are hidden by red curtains and show white question marks. Those hidden items could be anything, so I must take them into consideration. The rest of the grid cells are empty and white.

My priority now is to formulate a description that unequivocally isolates the target object. It's critical to make this description robust. Spatial cues like ""top-left"" are out, as the arrangement might change. I also have to assume that the hidden cells could contain objects. The unique feature here is the internal pattern: the target star's checkerboard pattern.

Let's brainstorm a few descriptions: ""It's a star with a checkerboard pattern inside,"" is concise and accurate. ""Select the star filled with grey and white checks,"" is another option. ""There are two stars. One has vertical stripes inside, and the one I want has a checkered pattern inside."" This is more conversational and contrasts the visible stars. Finally, ""The object is a star with a thick black outline, filled with a grey and white checkerboard pattern."" That's very detailed and precise.

Choosing the best description is about effectiveness and efficiency. A simple, direct approach is usually best. The key to differentiating the two visible stars is the internal pattern. I'll need a description that makes the target obvious.

I'm leaning towards ""The star with the checkerboard pattern inside."" It's clear, accurate, and highlights the crucial difference. It's unlikely to be confused with a hidden object *unless* another star has the same pattern. However, given the context, I think the chances of a match are low.

Final check: I'm not using any spatial references. It's specific to the target object because of its unique pattern, and I'm confident it's clear and easy to understand.
Therefore, ""The star with the checkerboard pattern inside"" is the description I will use.
"
exp2_027.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,star,blue,checker,"1,3",Select the star with the blue outline and the grey and white checkerboard pattern inside.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, here's how I'm approaching this reference game. My primary objective is to describe the target object – a blue star with a grey and white checkerboard interior – in a way that allows another person to identify it uniquely, given that they can see the entire scene.

First, I analyzed the visual information. I see a 3x3 grid, where some cells are empty, some contain visible objects, and some are obscured by red curtains with question marks. The target is highlighted for *me* but the listener can see the full set of objects. This means I need a description that is independent of its perceived location in the grid.

I need to make sure the object can be distinguished from what is visible, and especially from what *might* be behind the curtains.

Now, let's identify what's visible. I've got a blue star with a checkerboard pattern, and a triangle with a red border and grey dots. I also acknowledge that I *don't* know what's behind those curtains.

Next comes the crucial part: formulating the description. I know I have to avoid positional cues. I can't rely on ""bottom-left"" or similar language because the listener might have a different perspective or arrangement.

The core of my description will focus on the target's distinctive features. The object is a star, which is a key shape. It has a blue border or outline. And importantly, its interior is filled with a grey and white checkerboard pattern.

I consider contrast. The triangle has a red border and grey dots. These two objects are clearly distinguishable. But I need to account for what *might* be present behind the curtains. There could be other stars, other blue objects, or other checkerboard patterns. Thus, I need to combine multiple features to avoid ambiguity.

My strategy evolves from ""the star"" (too vague) to ""the blue object"" (still vague) to ""the object with a checkerboard pattern"" (still potentially ambiguous). The combination, ""the blue star with a checkerboard pattern inside"" is significantly more precise.

After some refinement and experimentation with phrasing, I arrive at the final description. I'll make it precise and unambiguous.

**The final description I will give is:** ""Select the star that has a blue outline and a grey and white checkerboard pattern inside.""

This description combines the most essential features: the star shape, the blue border, and the checkerboard pattern, making it robust against potential distractors or ambiguities that might exist in the scene.

exp2_028.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,triangle,blue,dot,"1,1",The blue triangle.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to craft a description of a target object that's so precise, the listener can identify it without ambiguity. Here's how my mind is working through this:

First, I need to *really* analyze the scene. I see a 3x3 grid, and there are four objects in it. Each of these objects has some basic properties. I've noted down the specifics: a blue triangle with grey dots, a black square with grey dots, a green triangle with grey dots, and a black star with grey dots. I’m keying in on those distinguishing features.

Now, I zero in on the *target*. The red dashed box highlights the blue triangle with grey dots. Perfect. This is the one.

There are certain rules to this game. I'm not allowed to use positional cues like ""top left"". That’s a good starting point, as I need to be as robust as possible to different arrangements of objects. Also, I need to keep in mind there could be hidden objects, so I should be focused on *intrinsic* properties, not relative ones.

The crux of this is creating a description that's *unique*. I need to discriminate the blue triangle from the square, the other triangle, and the star. I break down the features. I have a shape (triangle), a color (blue outline), and a fill (grey dots).

I start to formulate different candidates. ""The triangle"" alone won't work – there's a green one. ""The blue object"" is better, but maybe there are other blue objects that I can’t see. However, ""the blue triangle"" starts to sound like a solid answer as it includes both key features.

I’m also considering ""The triangle with the blue outline"". That's very precise! But I think ""The blue triangle"" does a better job and is also more concise. I then considered if mentioning the grey dots inside helps, but it’s a shared feature, so it doesn't help me.

Finally, a quick final check: Does ""The blue triangle"" absolutely nail it? Absolutely. Does it avoid positional references? Yes. Is it clear and concise? Yes.

Therefore, ""The blue triangle"" is my final answer.
"
exp2_029.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,circle,red,wavy,"1,3",Select the circle with the red outline and the gray wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My goal is to describe a specific object on this grid so someone else can pick it out. I need to be as clear as possible, considering the possibility of hidden objects!

First, I need to understand the visual context. I see a 3x3 grid, and the target object, which is in the bottom-left corner, is highlighted with a red box.

Now, let's break down the object itself. It's a circle. The outline is red, and inside, it has a gray wavy line pattern.

I need to create a description that is unambiguous. My initial thought is just ""the circle,"" since it's the only one. However, the mention of hidden objects changes things. There's a chance a hidden object *could* be another circle, with a different color or pattern.

To ensure clarity, I'll compare the target to all the other objects:

*   **Top-middle:** A red-outlined star with a gray wavy pattern. This star is similar, sharing both the red outline and the wavy pattern. So, ""the red shape with the wavy pattern"" is not sufficient!

*   **Middle-left:** A green-outlined triangle with a gray and white checkerboard pattern.

*   **Middle-right:** A blue-outlined triangle with gray polka dots on a white background.

*   **Bottom-right:** A black-outlined star with a gray and white checkerboard pattern.

Now, let's craft the description: ""The circle with the red outline and wavy pattern"" is the most unique description.

This is robust.

Let's phrase it as a natural instruction. I could say, ""The target is the circle with the red outline and gray wavy pattern inside.""

The best strategy is to be as specific as possible. The presence of hidden objects means I need to provide enough detail so the listener *can't* mistake it for something else, even something unseen.

So, I'm going with: ""Select the circle that has a red outline and a gray wavy line pattern inside.""
"
exp2_030.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,circle,green,wavy,"3,2",The circle with the green border and the wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object clearly enough that someone else can pick it out. I'm looking at a 3x3 grid, though only four cells are filled. The target is highlighted with a red dashed box, so let's start there.

1.  **Analyze the Target:** It's a circle. The border is green, and the inside has a grey and white wavy pattern.

2.  **Contextual Analysis:** I need to consider the other objects to make my description unique. There's a green-bordered triangle with grey dots, a blue-bordered triangle with a checkerboard, and a blue-bordered circle also with a checkerboard.

3.  **Forming a Description:** I need to be precise. ""The circle"" is out; there are two. The green border helps, but the triangle also has a green border. But the *pattern* is unique! No other object has that wavy design. ""The object with the wavy pattern"" seems promising. ""The green circle"" is also unique, but let's see.

4.  **Evaluate Descriptions:** ""The wavy pattern"" is strong, a single standout feature. ""The green circle"" is also good, combining shape and color into a unique descriptor. ""The circle with the green border"" is redundant to ""the green circle"".

5.  **Ambiguity Check:** The instructions mentioned potential hidden objects, so I should be robust. Another ""green circle"" could be hidden, but another object with the *wavy* pattern seems less likely. Therefore, the pattern is the most robust description.

6.  **Choosing the Best:** ""The object with the wavy pattern"" is my initial choice. It's concise and uses the most distinguishing feature. But ""The green circle"" is very good too! Perhaps combining both is ideal.

    Let's combine it as follows: ""The green circle with the wavy pattern inside."" It's precise but perhaps too long. Let's see if we can get a bit shorter.

    Let me consider the listener's perspective. They see two circles, but only one with waves. The green circle and the green triangle are easy to distinguish because of the shapes. 

    Re-evaluating, the simple but precise descriptions of the target object are: ""The object with the wavy pattern"" and ""The green circle.""

    Given that the instructions emphasize potential for hidden objects, that unique wavy pattern feels safest. Describing the pattern minimizes ambiguity with a less distinct solid circle.

    The instruction also says ""objects might be arranged differently for the other person"", so I cannot assume spatial information. Let's go with, ""The circle with the wavy pattern.""

    I will use the phrase: ""The circle with the wavy pattern."" It's direct, uses the most unique feature, and is very clear. It should be easy for the listener to distinguish.
"
exp2_031.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,circle,green,checker,"2,1",It's the circle with the checkerboard pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My goal is to describe a specific object in an image so someone else can identify it. First, I need to analyze the scene. It's a grid, a 3x3 layout, but with some merged cells. There are three visible elements: a circle, a triangle, and a curtain with question marks. The target is clearly marked; it's the circle in the top-middle cell. It has a green outline, and inside is a grey and white checkerboard pattern.

My first thought is to zero in on the unique features. I have to create a description that’s precise enough to separate the target from the triangle and whatever is behind that curtain. The rule is no spatial references. I have to avoid saying “the one on top” and rely on intrinsic properties.

I begin comparing: the target (circle/checkerboard) versus the triangle (green outline, wavy lines). Shape and the internal pattern are the most obvious differentiators. Color is a bit less useful; both share the green outline and grey/white color scheme, but the pattern is clearly different. The curtain is irrelevant to my description because it has no shape.

So, the ideal description needs to focus on those two crucial features: *shape* and *pattern*. A good description combines them. I considered starting with ""It's a circle"" and then adding more details. ""It has a checkerboard pattern inside,"" or ""a grey and white checkerboard pattern"" to be more specific.

I realize the internal pattern is the most defining characteristic, even if there is an identical circle behind the curtain. The triangle has wavy lines. I need to convey this unique feature. I can start by saying, ""It's a circle with a checkerboard pattern."" The addition of the outline color is probably not that important, but I considered adding it.

The descriptions I formulated were:

*   ""Select the circle with a checkerboard pattern.""
*   ""The object is a circle with a green border. Inside, there's a grey and white checkerboard pattern.""
*   ""Look for the shape that has a checkerboard pattern.""
*   ""Look for the circular object.""
*   ""The object is a circle with a grey and white checkerboard pattern inside and a green outline.""
*   ""It's the shape with the checkerboard pattern inside.""

I discarded the ones that were too short or didn't focus on both key features.

The strategy that seems the most robust is to combine the shape and the pattern. The others are less specific. The final, most concise and effective option is ""It's the circle with the checkerboard pattern inside."" It's direct, leaves little room for ambiguity, and uses the best information from the comparison. It doesn't rely on location and is specific to the target. This description should be clear, and should uniquely identify the target object.
"
exp2_032.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,4,triangle,red,stripe,"3,3",The object you should select is the triangle that is filled with vertical stripes.,"**Analyzing the Reference Game**

Okay, so I'm being asked to play a speaker role in a reference game. My objective is to guide someone to a specific target object within a visual display. The game's got some constraints: I can't rely on spatial locations like ""bottom right,"" and I need to account for hidden objects that the listener can see, but I can't. The target is helpfully highlighted, so I know which object is the goal.

First, I need to understand the visual field. It's a 3x3 grid, and some cells have objects while others are empty or hidden behind question mark curtains. I take inventory of what's visible: a blue-outlined star with a wavy gray/white fill, a blue-outlined circle with a gray/white checkerboard fill, a green-outlined circle with vertical gray/white stripes, and crucially, the target: a *red*-outlined triangle with vertical gray/white stripes, enclosed in a dashed red box – my cue!

The hidden objects are unknown, so I need to describe the target robustly enough that it stands out no matter what's lurking behind those curtains.

Let's focus on the target. It's a triangle with a red outline and vertical stripes. My main task is to distinguish it from the other visible objects. Comparing the visible objects, I see that this target is different from the star in shape, outline color, and fill pattern, and from the checkerboard circle in those same three features. However, the striped circle in the bottom middle shares the *fill pattern* with the target. But its shape and outline color are different.

To create a unique and effective description, I'll need to consider what properties differentiate the target from other objects. Here are a few things to keep in mind, and some possible options I thought about, in order of simplicity: ""It's the triangle."" ""It's the red shape."" ""It's the shape with vertical stripes."" ""It's the red triangle."" ""It's the triangle with vertical stripes."" ""It's the red triangle with vertical stripes."" Each has strengths and weaknesses. The simplest options risk ambiguity if the listener sees a similar hidden object.

I need to make sure my description is robust, in case there's another red triangle, or a triangle with a different pattern, or some other red shape with stripes behind the curtains. So combining features is key: I could say ""the red triangle"" or ""the triangle with vertical stripes"" or ""the red triangle with vertical stripes"".

So, I think I'll go with a concise yet specific description. ""The triangle with vertical stripes"" works. It immediately distinguishes it from the green-outlined circle with stripes. My thought here is that the shape is pretty unambiguous.
"
exp2_033.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,star,green,stripe,"3,3",The object with vertical stripes inside.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I need to describe an object within this grid so a listener can identify it. My immediate thought is to break this down methodically. I need to make this description robust and unambiguous.

First, I analyze the visual data. There's a 3x3 grid with four objects visible, each with a different shape, border color, and internal pattern. The target is highlighted – a green star with vertical stripes inside.

Next, I recognize the constraints. I can't use positional descriptions, which is smart because the listener may have a different arrangement. I have to create a description that uniquely identifies this green star amongst the other objects, including any potentially hidden ones. I can see all the objects, so I don't have to worry about hidden objects right now.

My first thought is to isolate unique features. The shape is a strong candidate, a star versus a circle, square, and triangle. The internal pattern, vertical stripes, is also unique. The green color is less useful initially, as another object is also green.

Now, I start to formulate descriptions. ""The green star"" is good, but potentially ambiguous if a hidden object also has a green border. ""The star with vertical stripes"" is also good, but potentially ambiguous if another object has vertical stripes. Combining them, ""The green star with vertical stripes"" seems strong, and very specific.

I consider the relative robustness of each description. Using the pattern (vertical stripes) seems promising. It's a more complex feature. I also consider the possibility of hidden objects. A single word can be ambiguous, so I look for something that cannot be easily copied.

I think of alternatives, like a comparison or negation (""the green object that isn't a circle""). This is a good way to exclude other options, but it's less direct. ""The star that isn't a circle, square, or triangle."" That’s just another way of saying “The star.”

I look at the key properties: the target is a star, the border is green, and the pattern is stripes. The distractors: the circle has a green border and a checkerboard pattern, the square has a black border and a dot pattern, and the triangle has a blue border and a dot pattern. The shared attribute of green is not useful, because the distractor of the circle also has a green border.

The *most* unique combination appears to be the shape (star) *and* the internal pattern (vertical stripes), and the star shape is very iconic. The pattern is also very clear. However, considering other scenarios is important.

I will focus on the most unique feature: ""The object filled with vertical stripes."" The pattern is a complex visual attribute, and is distinct from the other patterns (checkerboard, dots). I can also use ""the star with vertical stripes,"" but I am leaning towards patterns, as those are not as obvious. I am confident that “The object with vertical stripes” is clear and unambiguous given the set.
"
exp2_034.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,square,red,dot,"1,3",The square with the red dashed outline.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the task is to describe an object in a 3x3 grid so someone else can pick it out, but I'm the only one who can see the red dashed box around the target. Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to analyze the image: there's a 3x3 grid, some cells are empty, some have objects, and some are obscured by curtains. The target is highlighted with a red dashed box, which is key.

My focus is the target object, which is in the bottom-left corner of the grid (row 3, column 1). It's a square. I see that it has a red, dashed outline and inside are grey dots. Now, I have to remember that I can’t tell the other person that it has a red dashed outline because they can’t see the box! I must describe the object *without* explicitly mentioning the box.

I need to identify the other visible objects, because I need to differentiate the target object from them. Looking around, there's another square in the top-left corner, and a circle in the top-middle and another circle in the bottom-middle. What’s behind the curtains doesn’t matter right now. The squares look the same in shape, and both have grey dots, so that's not the distinguishing factor. The circles have patterns, too. I need to figure out how to describe the target square so that the person I am talking to will select it.

Okay, let's compare the objects. The target is a square filled with grey dots and the other square has grey dots too. However, the other square has a black, solid outline. Aha! The distinction is the outline. The other circle is striped and the green-outlined circle is striped. I have to focus on the outline! My description needs to use the outline to distinguish the target object from the other ones. So, the distinguishing feature is the *outline*. The target square has a red dashed outline, and the other square has a black, solid outline.

So, I need to formulate a description. If I start with ""It's a square filled with grey dots,"" that's not enough; the other square has the same description. But if I add ""and has a red dashed outline"", then I have a complete description. The person I'm describing the object to can use the shapes, and then select the object that has a red dashed outline, which the other square does not.

Could there be another square with a red dashed outline behind a curtain? Possibly, but unlikely. I should focus on the visible properties and not the location. This is important: ""Please do not use degenerate spatial locations"" and ""The objects might be arranged differently for the other person."" I can’t say ""the one in the bottom left"". So, ""the square with the red dashed outline"" and the description is concise and accurate, and it's the most salient, unique feature.

So, here's the plan. I'll say ""It's the square with a red, dashed outline"". Let me just make a final check. Does that work? Does this description distinguish the object from the others? The other square? Different outline (red dashed vs. black solid). The circle has a different outline (red dashed vs. black solid). The other circle, a different shape (square vs. circle), different outline (red dashed vs. green solid). Yes! That's it!

So, the final utterance is, ""The square with the red dashed outline."" Clear and concise!

exp2_035.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,star,black,dot,"3,2",The star with the black outline.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, here's how I'm thinking through this reference game. The user wants me to describe a specific object so the listener can identify it. My goal is clarity and efficiency.

First, I need to understand what I'm looking at. I see a 3x3 grid. The top-right cell contains the target object, a black-outlined star with grey dots inside. There's also a green-outlined star with grey dots in the top-right, a distractor, and two hidden items behind the red curtain with question marks. The rest of the grid is blank.

Now, I zero in on the target. It's a black-outlined, five-pointed star with a dotted interior. This is the crucial information. I need to distinguish it, and the listener needs to understand the differences from the distractor and whatever else is hidden.

The obvious distinguishing feature is the outline color. The visible distractor, a green star, is differentiated by the fact that it's green-outlined. The dotted interior is the same for both. So mentioning the dots alone is likely not enough to differentiate the objects.

The most straightforward description is, ""The star with the black outline."" This is concise, unambiguous, and focuses on the key visual property that separates the target from the green star, and I can't know about the hidden ones. 

I considered using location (""the middle-right star""), but that's risky because the listener's perspective might be different. I could also mention the dotted interior, but that might be more verbose than necessary, and it’s not the primary distinguishing feature.

Ultimately, ""The star with the black outline"" is the best approach. It's accurate, efficient, and relies on the visible features, and is robust based on the information I have. Let's see if this works!
"
exp2_036.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,star,green,dot,"2,1",Select the star that is filled with dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the goal is clear: I need to describe the highlighted target object in this reference game so someone else can select it from the grid. It's like a sophisticated game of ""I Spy,"" but I have to be precise. The image I'm analyzing is a 3x3 grid, and the target is marked with a dashed red box. My first step is to thoroughly break down the visual information.

The grid has several objects. I need to note the properties of all the items, not just the target. I see a circle, a couple of stars, and some triangles. The target itself is a star with a green outline and a grey and white dotted fill. Other stars have different colors and patterns. The color green is also represented by a triangle with a green border.

Now, I'm considering what makes the target unique. Location is out since the instructions advise against using location information. Shape isn't enough – there are multiple stars. Outline color? No, there's another green object, the green triangle. Fill pattern! Ah, the dotted fill is *unique* among all the visible objects. This is a crucial detail. I need to focus on this, and then combine it with shape.

I'm starting to build potential descriptions in my mind. The most straightforward might be simply, ""the object with dots."" That's concise, and the fill pattern is the most distinctive feature. But I should be robust. I'm thinking, ""It's a star with dots inside,"" is much more descriptive. That gives shape and unique feature. I could also say ""It's the green star,"" but that still requires the listener to distinguish it from the green triangle. I can combine these, too: ""the green star with dots inside.""

The most important part of this is to make sure there is no ambiguity. My goal is for the listener to find this target with zero error. I need to make sure I am not relying on a coincidence that could be misinterpreted.

I've got a couple of options: ""The dotted object"" or ""the star with dots."" So the combination is a safety net.

I'm leaning towards, ""the star filled with dots."" I like the simplicity. The only item that shares a common category with the object is another star, and the pattern will be the key to it being correct. That should be unambiguous, as it combines the unique fill with the shape.

The most basic phrase, “the star with dots,” I think is the most robust and complete. It's direct, it specifies the category (star), and it clearly identifies the unique fill pattern. It should be perfect. I'll stick with that.

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My goal is to describe a target object so another person can identify it. The object is highlighted with a dashed red box, but I'm told I'm the only one who can see that. That's a critical piece of information. I can't use the box to help me.

Looking at the image, I see the object. It's in the top-left corner of a 3x3 grid. Inside that cell, the object is a triangle. It has a thick, black border, and inside the triangle, there's this pattern of wavy, zigzagging lines. The lines are grey and white, which is visually distinct. I also see other objects: the red curtain with a question mark, the checkerboard pattern, and empty cells.

So, what makes this triangle unique? I've got a shape, an outline, and a pattern to work with. I need to make sure my description is accurate and clear enough to identify the correct object.

My immediate thought is to simply say ""the triangle with the wavy pattern inside"". But that might not be specific enough. I've got to consider what the other person might see behind the curtains. I have to be robust, in case there are other triangles with different patterns or colors, or no patterns at all.

Let me break it down. I could start with ""It's a triangle."" Then, ""It has a thick black border."" Then, ""The inside is filled with a grey and white wavy pattern."" Combining that into one clear sentence is a good starting point. I could also say ""Select the triangle that has a wavy grey and white pattern inside of its thick black border."" That feels fairly robust.

But are there other ways to describe it? Maybe focus on the pattern, or the shape, but I want to be specific, given the possibility of hidden objects behind the curtains. Since the game is set up this way, I need to make sure to be explicit about the pattern.

It's better to be specific. Thinking about it, the checkerboard is a square. So, that's easy to differentiate. The curtains could be hiding anything! The instructions say the objects might be arranged differently for the other person and that there are hidden objects. So, I can't rely on position, and I need to be more thorough to avoid confusion.

Okay, let's refine my description. I think ""the triangle with the wavy pattern"" seems pretty safe. But let's add some detail to make it super robust. Maybe ""the triangle with the thick black outline and a grey and white wavy pattern inside."" Now I am confident that is enough detail.

Let's test this. Is there anything I'm missing? The other objects are squares, and the background is white. I think I've covered all the unique elements. The dashed red box is just for me.

Alright, I think I've got it. I'll phrase it as a direct instruction to the other player. ""It's the triangle with a thick black outline, filled with a grey and white wavy pattern."" That's concise, clear, and includes all the key visual elements. I am confident that should work.

Or another option: ""Select the object that is a triangle with a black border and has grey and white squiggly lines inside it."" ""Squiggly"" is a good synonym for ""wavy"". But I think I prefer ""wavy"".

I am ready to provide the final description.

exp2_038.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,circle,red,stripe,"3,3",Select the circle with vertical stripes.,"**My Analysis of the Reference Game**

Okay, so I'm presented with a 3x3 grid, and my task is to describe a target object in the bottom-right cell so that someone else can identify it. This is a classic reference game scenario, and my approach is to be as precise and unambiguous as possible.

First, I need to *really* look at the image. The grid is my frame of reference. I see the target in the bottom-right: a circle with vertical grey and white stripes, enclosed within a red-bordered circle, all of which is inside of a dashed red box. In the top-right, there's a square with a checkerboard pattern inside a green border, which is clearly a potential distractor. The top-left and middle-right cells each contain red curtains with a question mark—hidden objects. I have to assume the other person *can* see those. That means I need to make my description *uniquely* identify the bottom-right object, and it cannot rely on anything I cannot see.

I need to determine the essential features that set this target apart from everything else. The other key features are:

*   **Shape:** It's a circle. The checkerboard is a square. Shape is a great starting point for distinguishing.
*   **Pattern:** It has vertical stripes. The distractor has a checkerboard. This is the core of differentiation!
*   **Color**: The color of the pattern is grey and white.
*   **Border:** The circle is inside a red border. The square is inside a green border.

The critical thing is to create a description that leverages these features for optimal identification. I'm leaning toward the phrase ""the circle with vertical stripes"". This description gets to the heart of what makes the target unique: the specific shape and the specific pattern. It's concise, clear, and focused on the key differentiating factors. It's a description that, in my experience, would be a strong and efficient way to pinpoint the target in this kind of reference game. I don't need to overcomplicate things. It's the simplest description that encompasses shape and content which is the key here. So, let's keep it clean.

exp2_039.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,triangle,blue,wavy,"3,1",The triangle with the wavy lines inside.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I need to describe this object so someone else can identify it in a reference game. My primary goal is unambiguous identification. Let's break down my thought process:

First, I need to thoroughly analyze the target object. It's a triangle, with a blue, solid border, and filled with a grey and white wavy line pattern. Critically, I have to ignore the red dashed box that only I can see.

Next, I need to consider all the visible distractors. There's a square with a blue border and grey dots, a circle with a green border and the same wavy line pattern as my target, and another triangle with a blue border and grey dots. Two more objects are hidden behind red curtains. The other player can see them, but I can’t.

Now, I start crafting my description. Simply saying ""It's a triangle"" is useless, as there are two visible. Mentioning the blue border won't help either, as two other shapes also have it. The key is that the wavy line pattern is unique to the circle and my target among the visible objects. So, it's a triangle with the wavy line pattern.

That’s a good starting point, but I need to consider the hidden objects. Could one of them be another triangle with a wavy pattern? I want my description to be as robust as possible. I'll include all key features: shape, border color, and fill pattern. ""A triangle with a blue border and a wavy pattern inside."" Now I'll check my descriptor against the distractors: The top-left object is a square with blue border and dots; the middle-left is a circle with a green border and wavy pattern, and the bottom-middle object is a triangle with blue border and dots.

This sounds good, but I'll make sure it's the most concise and effective. ""The triangle filled with wavy lines."" or ""The triangle with the wavy lines"" sounds perfect. It distinguishes the target from the other visible shapes.

I also need to check it against the rules of the game: No spatial references are allowed, and definitely no mention of the red dashed box. Given the visible distractors, the description is not ambiguous. Because of the inclusion of the shape and fill pattern, the descriptor is robust enough to handle the hidden objects, too. The combination ""Triangle"" + ""wavy lines"" should be strong enough to distinguish the object.

I’m confident the most important feature to focus on is the fill pattern, as it is the distinguishing factor from the other triangle. The shape is the most important part of the distinction from the circle.

So, I will go with ""The triangle that has wavy lines inside it."" This is simple, effective, and clearly differentiates it from the other triangle with dots.

exp2_040.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,square,blue,stripe,"1,3",Select the square with the blue outline and vertical stripes.,"**Analyzing the Reference Game**

Okay, here's the situation: I need to describe a target object in an image so someone else can select it in this reference game. The image is a 3x3 grid, and the target is a square in the bottom left, highlighted by a red box. Spatial references are out, and I also need to be aware that there *could* be hidden objects, but not in *this* specific instance. 

Let's break down the image:  I see five objects – a striped circle, a wavy triangle, the striped square (our target), a checkered triangle, and another striped circle.  I need to describe the square, keeping in mind clarity and efficiency.

The features of the target object are: a blue outline and vertical gray stripes inside a square. ""The square"" alone would be enough because there's only one. But, other objects have blue outlines and vertical stripes, so I need to make the description precise.

I consider: ""the blue square,"" ""the square with vertical stripes,"" and ""the blue object with vertical stripes"". ""The blue object with vertical stripes"" is ambiguous. ""The blue square"" or ""the square with vertical stripes"" works.

The shape (square) is the most defining feature in this image. I want to be concise and accurate. ""Select the square"" is the shortest, but might be too short. Adding features can help, like ""the blue square"" or ""the square with vertical stripes"".

I'm trying to decide between ""the blue square"" and ""the square with vertical stripes"" or a combination. The ""square"" part is key. Since there's only one square, that's the most distinguishing feature. So, ""the square"" is good. The other features are also good and can be combined.

I could say, ""The object is a square with a blue outline."" or ""Select the square."" or ""The square with a blue border and vertical stripes inside."" or ""The blue square."" or ""The square with vertical stripes."" The blue outline is shared with the target and the circle in the bottom right. The vertical stripes are shared with the target, as well as the top left and bottom right circle. I must include the shape. The square shape is unique among all the objects. Adding a feature helps make the selection accurate.

After all this analysis, the two best options are: ""The square with the blue outline"" or ""The square with vertical stripes"". The shape is the most distinctive feature. I need to be unambiguous and efficient. Both of these combinations should work and are equivalent.

exp2_041.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,circle,red,dot,"3,1",It's the circle filled with grey dots that has a red outline.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. The goal is to describe a specific object in this grid so the listener can identify it. My thinking is, first, I need to *really* analyze the visual scene. I've got a 3x3 grid; some cells are empty, some filled with visual elements. There are two ""hidden"" items - those red curtains with question marks. Those are out of bounds for my description. I only get to describe what I can see. I've also spotted two circles filled with grey dots. One has a black outline, and the other, my target, has a red outline.

My primary task is to pinpoint the *target*. I've identified that it's the circle with grey dots and a red outline. It's important to not use any spatial location clues, since the grid might be different for the listener. That means no ""top right corner"" or anything like that. Instead, I need to focus on *features*.

I'm identifying the other elements to identify any that might confuse my listener:
*   Red curtain with a question mark
*   Another red curtain with a question mark
*   Circle with grey dots and a black outline

Now I'm formulating my description. I have to avoid spatial references and focus on features. I can see two circles filled with grey dots, so I have to distinguish between them. The obvious distinguishing factor is the outline color. A basic description would be ""the circle with the red outline."" But I think I need to be *slightly* more detailed to reduce any ambiguity. My priority is being accurate, so I'm planning to compare the differences between the two circles.

I considered a few options: ""There are two circles with dots inside, select the one with the red border."" or ""It is the circle with grey dots and a red outline."" and finally landed on ""It's the circle filled with grey dots that has a red outline."" This is concise, unambiguous, and, importantly, doesn't use any spatial clues or refer to those hidden items. I'm focusing on the *observable* and *unique* properties of the target.
"
exp2_042.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,circle,red,wavy,"3,3",Select the circle with the red border.,"**My Thought Process: Solving the Reference Game**

Okay, the task is a reference game – I need to describe a target object clearly so someone can pick it out from a set. I'm checking my constraints: I'm the speaker, I need to describe the target, I can't use spatial locations that could be ambiguous, and I'm assuming hidden objects aren't relevant here. Got it. Confidence is high.

Let's dive in. First, I'm analyzing the target: it's a circle, red outline, filled with a wavy gray and white pattern. Now, the distractors: there's a star with red and striped grey, a square with black wavy grey, and a star with polka dot grey.

I'm starting to formulate descriptions. ""It's the circle"" feels efficient. But could it be too simple? ""It's the red circle"" is also pretty good, as is ""the circle with the wavy pattern"". I need to select the best one. Considering there is only one circle, ""It's the circle"" appears optimal.

I'm now refining. I'm focusing on the *most* unique feature. ""It's the circle with the wavy lines inside."" That seems robust, using both shape and pattern. But maybe it's too wordy. I can be more concise. If there is only one circle, ""Select the circle"" is efficient, maybe a bit too risky. It must be efficient and robust.

Let me analyze the other attributes. The red border is shared. The wavy pattern is shared. The shape, however, is unique. Therefore, ""the circle"" is the most efficient and robust description.

Let me try a final refinement. ""The object is a circle with a red border and a gray wavy pattern inside."" That is very descriptive. A shorter, more natural version might be, ""Select the circle with the wavy pattern.""

Breaking it down:

*   Shape: circle (unique)
*   Border color: red (shared with one star)
*   Fill pattern: wavy (shared with one square)

In the end, describing it just as ""the circle"" is sufficient, because that property is unique. I am aiming for efficiency. So I will go with ""It's the circle with the wavy pattern.""
"
exp2_043.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,star,green,wavy,"1,1",Select the green star that has a wavy pattern inside.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game, and my goal is to accurately describe the object within the red dashed box so that another player can select it from a grid. I need to be precise, especially since the arrangement might change for them.

First, I need to understand the target. It's a star, with a green outline and a grey, wavy or zigzag pattern inside. And it's in the top-left cell. But I can't use ""top-left"", so I have to describe it only by its features.

Next, I look at the distractors. There's another star with a green outline, but the inside has vertical stripes. There's also a triangle (red outline, vertical stripes), a square (red outline, vertical stripes), and a circle (black outline, checkerboard). There are four empty cells too.

I quickly realize the key to a good description is distinguishing the target from that other similar star. Both are stars and both have green outlines. Therefore, it comes down to the internal pattern. The target has a wavy pattern; the distractor has vertical stripes.

I then go through a few different descriptions. ""It's a star,"" is too generic. ""It's a green star,"" still isn't specific enough. But ""It's the star with the wavy pattern inside"" hits the mark! That's it! It is accurate and distinct. ""The green star filled with a grey wavy pattern"" is even better as it includes the color.

The arrangement can change, so I must avoid spatial descriptions. I need to rely solely on the features of the target. I want to keep it simple, but robust. ""The star with the wavy pattern inside"" works perfectly as it distinguishes it from the other star in the grid. ""The green star that has a wavy pattern inside"" provides all the information needed and will be unambiguous.

Looking at the distractors one last time, the other star has vertical stripes, the triangle and square have red outlines and vertical stripes, and the circle has a black outline and a checkerboard pattern.

So, the critical features are shape (star), outline color (green), and internal pattern (wavy/zigzag). I'll choose to make it clear what differentiates the target the most. Since there is only one object with a wavy pattern, ""The star with the wavy pattern"" is sufficient and unambiguous. ""The green star with the wavy pattern inside"" is an excellent, very robust, and highly specific choice. That is what I will use!

exp2_044.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,square,red,dot,"1,3",It's the square with a red border that's filled with grey dots.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm in a reference game. The goal is to accurately describe a target object within an image so someone else can pick it out. Let's break this down. First, I need to analyze the scene. There's a 3x3 grid, some empty cells, some with objects, and some hidden. I'm focusing on the target object, which is helpfully highlighted by this dashed box (which I presume is only visible to me).

Now, what am I looking at? There's a circle with green borders and grey dots in the top middle, another circle, green border with stripes, top right. Then two objects hidden. The target, in the bottom left, is what really matters. I see a square with a solid red border, and filled with grey dots. Two more hidden objects.

The key is in describing *uniquely*. I have to make sure my description, even with the presence of distractors (the other visible objects and the unknown hidden objects), identifies that *specific* object and nothing else.

So, let's nail down this target. It's a square. Crucially, the border is a solid red. The filling is an array of grey dots against a white background. Now, there's another dot-filled object – a circle – but its border is green. Aha. Shape and color are the two biggest differentiators here.

Here’s where it gets interesting. I need to account for those hidden objects. It's possible something similar could be behind those curtains, which is why I need to be as specific as possible. If I say ""The object with dots,"" that's ambiguous. But if I say ""The red-bordered square with dots,"" I'm giving a specific description that will easily distinguish the object.

I'm thinking about how I'd formulate the best description. I'm going to lead with shape, because it's a prominent feature. Then border color, then the fill pattern. Let's start with ""It's a square,"" and follow it up with ""It has a red border,"" and finish with ""Inside the square, there are grey dots."" I could phrase this differently, of course. “The red-bordered square filled with grey dots” is also solid. Or, I could say, ""Select the square that has a red border and is filled with grey dots.""

The key is that I need to be unambiguous, location-agnostic (don't say bottom left), and specific enough to distinguish it from everything else in the image, visible or hidden. My final description is: ""The object is a square with a red border, and it's filled with grey dots."" I'm confident that's the best way to uniquely identify this object.

exp2_045.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,triangle,black,stripe,"2,1",The triangle with vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My goal is to describe a target object within an image so someone else can identify it. Here's how I'm approaching this:

1.  **Image Analysis:** First, I'm taking a close look at the 3x3 grid. I see three visible objects: a triangle, a star, and a circle. The target object, highlighted, is clearly the triangle. I'm noting the positions, though the instructions tell me not to rely on spatial locations since the other player might see a different arrangement.

2.  **Object Feature Extraction:** Now I need to break down the features. The triangle has a thick black outline and vertical grey and white stripes. The star has the same thick black outline, and the same vertically striped fill pattern. The circle has a different pattern: a wavy, squiggly grey and white line pattern, also with a thick black outline.

3.  **Distinguishing the Target:** My core task is to differentiate the triangle from the other objects. The critical difference is the shape. Since there's only one triangle visible, technically, ""the triangle"" would be sufficient to identify it. However, the other objects share some attributes, like the thick black outline and the striped fill pattern (shared with the star). The fill pattern differentiates the circle.

4.  **Formulating a Concise Yet Clear Description:** I need a description that's both accurate and unambiguous, and concise. ""The triangle"" alone works because there's only one triangle. But, adding more detail might be beneficial for clarity, so I'm considering ""the triangle with vertical stripes,"" since the other two objects are not triangles. I ruled out using spatial references (""top row,"" etc.) because the game rules say to avoid those. ""The shape with vertical stripes inside"" is good, too.

5.  **Final Considerations:** I'm keeping in mind that I can't rely on the other person seeing the same arrangement. My description must be based on the object's features. The statement mentions that the other grid cells are empty.

Therefore, for accuracy and clarity, I think **""The triangle with vertical stripes""** is the best option. It provides a unique identifier and is descriptive without being overly verbose. It leverages both shape and pattern to confirm the correct target. I also like ""The triangle"" as a concise option.
"
exp2_046.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,star,red,wavy,"2,1",The star with the red outline.,"**My Reasoning Process for the Reference Game**

Okay, here's the situation: I need to describe a target object so that another person can select it from a set of distractors. This is a classic reference game scenario, and I need to be as precise as possible to avoid ambiguity. My goal is to craft the most effective utterance.

First, I've got to analyze the target object. It's a star, five-pointed. The outline is red, and the fill is a grey and white wavy pattern. I should probably avoid any location-based descriptions, as this game tests object features.

Next, I need to thoroughly analyze the distractors. I see a green-outlined wavy triangle, a red-outlined dotted triangle, a black-outlined wavy square, and a black-outlined wavy star. There are also a few empty spaces, or perhaps as the prompt mentions, ""hidden objects"", but for this image, I'll ignore that element.

Now, let's formulate some descriptions and see which one uniquely identifies the target.

*   **Shape:** ""The star"" won't work because there's another star.
*   **Outline color:** ""The red object"" is out because there's also a red triangle.
*   **Fill pattern:** ""The wavy pattern"" is too general, as multiple objects share it.

Let's start combining features:

*   ""The star with the red outline."" Okay, does that uniquely define the target? Yes. The other star has a black outline, and the other red object is a triangle. This looks promising.
*   ""The star with the wavy pattern."" Not good. There's another star that also has this pattern.
*   ""The red object with the wavy pattern."" This also appears unique; the other red object has polka dots.
*   ""The star with the red outline and the wavy pattern."" This is definitely unique, but it might be overkill. I want to be concise.

""The star with the red outline"" is sufficient to distinguish the target. Let's make sure:

*   Target: Red Star, Wavy Fill.
*   Distractor Star: Black Star, Wavy Fill.
*   Distractor Red object: Red Triangle, Dotted Fill.

""The star with the red outline"" – perfect! The other star is black. I could also say ""The red object with the star shape"" or ""The red object with the wavy pattern"", but ""The star with the red outline"" is probably the most concise and direct way to achieve unique identification.
"
exp2_047.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,square,green,stripe,"1,3",The square filled with vertical grey stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the goal is clear: to guide someone to identify a specific object in this image, which I can see includes a 3x3 grid, though some cells are combined. I'm essentially playing a reference game. My job is to craft a description that uniquely identifies the target, which is the bottom-left square, without ambiguity.

First, I need to break down the scene. I can see a checkerboard circle, a dotted square, the target square (with its solid green border and vertical grey stripes), and a red curtain hiding some items. I'm focusing on the target object enclosed in that dashed red box; the other stuff is just noise that could potentially trick my ""listener.""

Now, it's time to zero in on the unique features of the target. I'm noticing it's a square with a solid green border and, crucially, filled with vertical grey stripes. The distractors – the circle and the dotted square – are quite different. The circle has a black border and a checkerboard, the dotted square has a dotted green border and dots.

The challenge, really, is to find a description that's *unambiguous*, especially since I can't see what's behind the curtain. Spatial references like ""bottom left"" are out because the listener might be viewing things differently. I must describe this visually.

My thinking is, I have to consider any objects that share features with the target object. It's time for a comparison: The target is a square, while the checkerboard object is a circle. The target has a solid green border while the other square has a dotted green border. The target is striped, while the other square has dots and the circle is a checkerboard.

Now, let's explore my options. ""The object with vertical grey stripes."" Seems good, direct and concise. But there might be another striped object hiding behind the curtain. ""The square with a solid green border"" could also work, as that's a key distinguishing feature. However, the *best* description combines the most unique features.

Let's refine. ""The square filled with vertical grey stripes."" This is good! It defines the shape, and its interior pattern differentiates it. It contrasts with the other square, which has dots, and the circle, which has a checkerboard. It's direct, precise, and, at least as far as I can tell, unique within the visible set of objects. This seems solid, but I have to acknowledge that there's always an element of uncertainty given the unknown hidden elements behind the curtain. Ultimately, the simplicity is what makes this the best choice.

I've got it. ""The square filled with vertical grey stripes."" I'm confident that should do the trick.
"
exp2_048.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,square,red,stripe,"3,3",The square with the red dashed outline.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game and need to provide a clear description of the target object, which is indicated by the red dashed box. My focus is on making sure the listener can correctly identify the correct item. Let's analyze the image and start breaking down the visual information.

Firstly, I'll identify and analyze the image: it's a 3x3 grid with four objects. The target is a square in the bottom right. The important distinguishing features are the following: shape (a square), internal pattern (grey vertical stripes), outline color (red), and outline style (dashed). There's another square with grey vertical stripes, so simply saying ""the square"" won't work. The target object, as indicated by the dashed red box, has a red, dashed outline. I need to describe the object itself, not the interface elements.

I need to focus on what makes the target unique. Let's compare it to the other objects. The other square has a blue solid outline. The star has a red, solid outline. The circle has a black, solid outline.

So, the easiest way to clearly distinguish it is by the outline. Either the color (red) or the style (dashed), or both. ""The square with the red dashed outline"" sounds quite specific and robust. ""The square with the red outline"" is good. ""The square with the dashed outline"" also works. ""The vertically striped square with the dashed red outline"" is also good, although slightly longer.

I'm aiming for the most concise, yet unambiguous description. ""The square with the red dashed outline"" works, but I want to make sure it's the best. Since color often comes to mind first, ""The square with the red outline"" might work, too. However, since the star also has a red outline, it's safer to include the outline style in the description.

The listener should only see the red dashed outline on the object itself, not the red dashed selection box. My description should be of the object, not the interface. Therefore, ""The square with the red, dashed outline"" will do the trick. It combines two important distinguishing features in an efficient way. It's concise and precise.

Let's do a final check. My description: ""The square with the red dashed outline."" The blue square's outline is solid, and the star's is also solid. The circle's is black. So, this description is unambiguous, and should be very effective.

exp2_049.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,square,green,stripe,"1,1",The square with the green border.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the highlighted target object so someone else can pick it out, even though their view might be different and they can't see the red box around the target. Spatial descriptions are out, and I'm blind to the objects hidden behind the curtains.

First, I need to analyze the scene. Looks like a 3x2 grid. The target is a green-bordered, vertically striped square in the top left. Okay, I see two other visible objects: a green star with a checkerboard pattern and a black-bordered, vertically striped square. There are also two hidden objects behind red curtains; but since I can't see them, I must ignore these.

My task is to differentiate the target square from the visible distractors. Let's break down the target's features: It's a square, has a green border, and contains vertical grey and white stripes.

Now, let's compare those features to the other visible objects. The green star has a checkerboard pattern, so it's easily distinguishable. The other square also has the vertical stripes, but its border is black, not green. So, the only critical difference is the color of the border.

The most straightforward way to identify the target is to focus on what makes it unique. The ""square"" shape is shared. The ""vertical stripes"" pattern is also shared. The differentiating feature is the *green border*.

I'm thinking, I could say ""the square with the green border"" or ""the object with the green border and vertical stripes."" Both sound good, and it's a minimal description. But since a ""square"" is a more salient shape, I should stick with it as the primary identifying feature.

Let's test this description: ""The square with the green border."" It differentiates the target from: the other square because the border is different; and from the star because the shape is different.

Could there be hidden objects that match this? Well, I don't know, and I can't. I'm focusing on the *visible* objects. The game is designed so that a good description of the visible objects should work.

Alright, the description is solid. I'm sure of it. It's concise, accurate, and unambiguous. So, I will say: ""The square with the green border.""

exp2_050.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,star,red,stripe,"3,3",The star filled with vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Deciding on the Best Description**

Okay, the goal is to clearly identify a target object in a reference game. I'm given an image with a few objects: a target star, a distractor circle, and two hidden objects behind curtains. I can't use spatial terms, as the arrangement might change. I need to describe the star so the listener can pick it out, even if they know what's hidden behind the curtains.

First, I break down the visible elements. The target is a star with a red outline and grey/white vertical stripes. The distractor is a green-outlined circle with grey dots. The hidden objects are unknown, but the listener sees them. I have to avoid making assumptions about the hidden content, but I know what the listener *does* know.

My initial thought is to go for the simplest description: ""the star."" However, that's potentially too ambiguous. What if there's another star hidden? I need to build a robust description.

I considered shape, outline color, and fill pattern. ""The star,"" ""the red-outlined object,"" and ""the object with vertical stripes"" were initial options. But I quickly realized that to minimize ambiguity, I must combine features. A star with a red outline is better, but maybe a curtain has a red object. ""The object with vertical stripes"" would also work.

I then started running through scenarios. What if another star, identical or different, is hidden? The task's purpose is for disambiguation, so I should be as specific as possible. The fill pattern (vertical stripes) feels the most unique.

So, I started evaluating combinations: ""The star with vertical stripes"" combines shape and fill. ""The red-outlined star"" combines outline and shape. The fill pattern seems the most useful differentiator.

Then, I experimented with the wording. ""The striped star."" I'm liking this as a concise description that is unambiguous to the circle.

Finally, I considered a hypothetical scenario. Let's say behind one curtain is a blue square, and the other is another red star, but this one is solid. Now, ""the star"" and ""the red-outlined object"" are ambiguous. ""The striped star"" works perfectly. The striped pattern uniquely identifies the target. It's concise, unambiguous, and doesn't rely on spatial information. It's the optimal description.
"
exp2_051.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,triangle,black,wavy,"2,3",The object is a triangle with a wavy pattern inside.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I need to describe an object in this reference game. My goal is to be unambiguous and efficient. The other person needs to be able to pick it out of the mix without any spatial cues like ""bottom middle.""

First, I need to really *see* the target. It's a triangle in a 3x3 grid. Black outline, gray fill, and the fill is wavy lines, not straight ones.

Next, I look at the distractors – the other shapes. Top middle: circle with vertical stripes. Top right: star with dots. Middle right: another star with vertical stripes.

Now, let's craft a description. I'm focusing on features that make this object *unique*. The shape is a big one. It's the *only* triangle. The fill pattern is also unique, the only one with wavy lines. The black outline isn't unique, because one of the stars has the same black outline.

So, I could say ""the triangle"" or ""the object with wavy lines."" Those are both strong candidates on their own. Combining them seems safest, so I could say, ""the triangle with wavy lines inside.""

I want to be concise but clear. Is there any ambiguity? No, because there's only one triangle and only one wavy pattern. Other objects are similar in color but not shapes or patterns. Black outline is common but the other features are unique.

The simplest, clearest description is the best. ""The triangle with the wavy pattern"" is perfect. It works. Or maybe ""It's the triangle with wavy lines inside."" This emphasizes the shape first, then specifies the pattern.

I also considered ""The object is a triangle with a thick black outline and a gray wavy pattern inside."" This is a more complete description but potentially too verbose.

I'm thinking from the other person's perspective. What will they see immediately? Shape and pattern are the defining features. I want to make them think ""triangle,"" then ""wavy lines.""

So, I think ""The triangle with the wavy pattern"" is the sweet spot. It's direct, accurate, and gets to the point.

exp2_052.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,triangle,black,checker,"2,1",It's the triangle with the checkerboard pattern inside.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the ""speaker"" in this reference game. My task is clear: describe the object highlighted by the red dashed box in the image. I've got to do this in a way that’s unambiguous for the listener, who sees the same objects, potentially in a different order, and also has access to information hidden from me. I can’t use spatial terms, so it needs to be feature-based. This is important: two objects are obscured by red curtains, and I'm blind to them. I have to create a description based on my perspective, knowing the listener has the whole picture.

First, I need to *really* look at the target. It's a triangle with a thick black outline, and inside it, a checkerboard pattern of grey and white squares. Alright, that’s my starting point. Now, what else is visible? There's a circle with grey and white vertical stripes inside and a square with a grey and white checkerboard pattern. These are the *distractors* I need to differentiate from.

The hidden objects are the wildcard. I can't know what they are, but I have to assume the listener can see them and must be able to choose my intended object based on my description. The prompt implies I should assume the hidden objects could be anything, so I have to be as specific as possible. The goal is to make a description that is unambiguous *from my perspective*, and the listener's perspective is presumed.

My first thought was, ""It's the triangle."" But that's a gamble. Could one of the hidden objects also be a triangle? I need to refine that. ""It's the triangle with a checkerboard pattern inside,"" that's better. But then, there's the square, which *also* has a checkerboard pattern. If I just say ""checkerboard pattern,"" it's not enough. Shape and pattern are the critical features.

So, I combine them: ""the triangle with a checkerboard pattern."" That's unique among the visible objects. And the listener, knowing the contents behind the curtains, has a broader context to confirm my description. I cannot create a description of the unknown, but I can create a description, in good faith, based on what I can see.

To be sure, I’m also thinking through potential edge cases, like, what if there's another triangle with a checkerboard pattern hidden? This feels very unlikely, and the game’s goal is to make the correct selection, not to be a perfect description. By mentioning the shape and pattern, I force the listener to consider what is hidden and match my target's salient features.

Considering everything, I think the best approach is to make it as simple as possible. My description has to be clear, unambiguous, and, most importantly, based on *my* visible information. So, my final, concise instruction is: ""It's the triangle with the checkerboard pattern inside."" It's direct, feature-based, and considers the context of the game. It uses no spatial terms, it's specific, it distinguishes the target from the distractors, and it places the burden of hidden information on the listener, as intended.
"
exp2_053.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,triangle,red,stripe,"1,1",The shape with the red outline.,"**My Thought Process: Selecting the Optimal Description**

Okay, here's the situation. I need to describe an object so someone else can identify it, a classic reference game. First, I'm analyzing the target: a red-outlined triangle filled with vertical stripes. No surprises there. Then, I'm quickly surveying the ""distractors"": a blue-outlined square with dots, a blue-outlined square with stripes, and a blue-outlined star with dots.

My primary task is to find the *most effective* and *unambiguous* description. I'm focusing on features that make the target *unique*. I immediately identify the shape and outline color as the primary candidates because they have no duplicates. The vertical stripe fill pattern, however, is shared by another object.

Given this, I have a few immediate options. ""The triangle"" is a valid description. It is unique. Also, ""the shape with the red outline"" also works. I can also combine the unique properties, resulting in ""the red triangle"", which is the strongest choice so far. If I were to include the fill pattern, the description would be ""the triangle with vertical stripes"".

I'm also aware of the potential for hidden objects (implied by the instructions) and the need for a robust description that can withstand the presence of unseen objects. While the instructions are clear that a red curtain could hide more objects, it's not present here. I'll mentally note that I must be careful. If a hidden object is a different triangle, then the simpler description would not be adequate.

I go through the thought process of considering the options:
1. ""The triangle."" (Concise).
2. ""The shape with a red outline."" (Concise).
3. ""The triangle with the red outline."" (More descriptive, redundant, and safe).
4. ""The triangle with vertical stripes."" (Still descriptive).

The description that stands out as the most concise and complete is ""the red triangle."" This hits the unique shape and unique color features, making it immediately unambiguous. I mentally consider it again: ""the red triangle"" is a perfect fit. And if there *were* a hidden object that might share one of these features, this description is still the safest.

I consider the added properties again. ""Red, triangle, striped"". Unique properties: color and shape. Non-unique property: striped. Therefore, I can eliminate the striped property.

I have zeroed in on the best description. Let's simplify it further. The perfect description is, *""The red triangle.""* This is the best approach. It is effective, unambiguous, and handles the possibility of unseen distractors. It is simple enough for this task.
"
exp2_054.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,triangle,green,checker,"2,1",The shape with the checkerboard pattern.,"**Analyzing the Target and Formulating a Description**

Alright, the task is clear: I need to describe a specific object in a visual array so that someone else can pick it out. The target, indicated by the red dashed box, is in the top row, middle column. It's a triangle with a green outline and a grey and white checkerboard pattern inside.

My mind immediately starts working through the objects. The other shapes are a green-outlined square with vertical stripes (top left), a black-outlined triangle with stripes (top right), a black-outlined star with stripes (middle left), and a black-outlined square with grey polka dots on white (bottom right). There are also empty cells, but those don't factor in here.

First, I need to find a characteristic to uniquely identify the target object. The shape is a triangle. But there's another triangle! So just saying ""the triangle"" won't work. The outline is green, and the other triangle has a black outline. So ""the triangle with a green outline"" could work. The fill, however, is a checkerboard pattern. That's unique! No other object has that. ""The object with a checkerboard pattern"" would be enough to identify it. But what about combining the features for added clarity? ""The green triangle with the checkerboard pattern"" could work.

Then I must consider any possible ambiguities or constraints. I can't use spatial locations. Fine, I won't say ""the one in the middle."" There's also some talk about objects behind a red curtain, but there is no such curtain. So I can assume the other person can see everything I see. No hidden constraints here.

I need to come up with the best description. ""The object with the checkerboard pattern"" is concise and unambiguous. ""The green triangle"" also works because the other triangle has a black outline. A combination is safest: ""the green triangle with the checkerboard pattern"".

Let's break down the properties to be sure.

*   **Target:** Shape=Triangle, Outline=Green, Fill=Checkerboard
*   **Distractor 1:** Shape=Square, Outline=Green, Fill=Stripes
*   **Distractor 2:** Shape=Triangle, Outline=Black, Fill=Stripes
*   **Distractor 3:** Shape=Star, Outline=Black, Fill=Stripes
*   **Distractor 4:** Shape=Square, Outline=Black, Fill=Dots

The fill is the only unique feature. I can use the fill to distinguish it. ""The shape filled with a checkerboard pattern"" seems like a clear and concise description.
"
exp2_055.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,triangle,blue,dot,"3,3",The object with the blue border and the dotted pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing a Target Object in a Reference Game**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My task is to describe this target object so someone else can identify it. First, I need to analyze the scene. It's a 3x3 grid, and there are three distinct objects present. A square with a blue border and checkerboard pattern, a circle with a black border and dotted fill, and the target – a triangle with a blue border and a dotted fill, located in the bottom right.

The red box highlights the triangle, which is my cue. Now I need to come up with a description that's *uniquely* identifies it. I have to think about what makes this triangle different from the other objects. Shape is the most obvious differentiator: It's the only triangle. The other objects are a square and a circle. The square and triangle share the blue border, but have different fill patterns. The triangle and circle have the same dotted fill pattern, but different border colors.

So, I could say ""the triangle"" - simple and direct. Is that enough? The instructions mention avoiding degenerate spatial locations, which seems irrelevant here, and hidden objects, also irrelevant since everything is visible. It might be better to be more specific to provide extra information in case the person I'm describing the item to doesn't see it exactly as I do.

I could say ""The object with a blue border and dotted pattern,"" or ""the blue object with dots"" since this combines two distinguishing features that uniquely characterize it. I could also say ""the triangle with a blue border"" or ""the triangle filled with dots"", all of which work.

Thinking about it more, I want to use a description that's both concise *and* robust. I'll test each of these descriptions, comparing the item with each of the other items in turn. The ""blue-bordered object with dots"" approach seems especially strong since it uses a combination of properties, and this is the best general strategy for reference games. Let's go with ""the object with the blue border and the dotted pattern inside."" That's unambiguous and complete, and will make identifying the target simple.
"
exp2_056.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,triangle,blue,wavy,"3,2",The object with the blue outline.,"**Analyzing the Target Object for Effective Communication**

Okay, here's the situation: I need to describe a specific object, highlighted by a dashed red box, within a set of other objects. My primary goal is to provide a description that will allow another person to accurately identify it. I am trying to craft an unambiguous reference.

Let's break down the visible characteristics of the target. It's a triangle, with a blue outline and a grey wavy fill. I need to figure out what combinations of these features are *uniquely* descriptive, so let's start with a comparative analysis.

**Comparative Analysis**

There's a red-outlined triangle with a dotted fill, a green-outlined circle with a dotted fill, and a red-outlined circle with a wavy fill. Alright, let's look at each feature and compare. The target has a blue outline. Only it has a blue outline. The shape is a triangle, but there is another triangle. The fill pattern is wavy, but there is another wavy fill. Now, let's explore possible combinations to use to create the description.

*   ""The blue object"" works as long as there are no other blue objects.
*   ""The triangle with the wavy fill"" works as long as there aren't any other triangles with wavy fills.
*   ""The blue triangle"" works as long as there aren't any other blue triangles.

Based on the known objects, all of these descriptions would work. However, the instructions state that some objects might be hidden, so I need to be *cautious* in my approach to avoid ambiguity. The person I'm describing the object to can see everything, but I cannot.

Let's consider possible hidden objects: If I say ""the blue object"" and there is another blue object, it's ambiguous. If I say ""the wavy triangle"", and there is another triangle with a wavy pattern, it's ambiguous. Even ""the blue triangle"" might be ambiguous.

To ensure clarity in the face of uncertainty, I need to provide more information than necessary, so that my description remains unambiguous, even if there are hidden objects. A combination of features would be a better choice. ""The blue triangle"" is simple but it's not robust.

So, let's compare those three descriptions more carefully: ""the blue triangle"", ""the triangle with the wavy pattern"", ""the blue object with the wavy fill"". ""The blue object with the wavy fill"" appears to be the most robust but it also might be too long. ""The triangle with the blue outline"" is more straightforward.

If I say ""the blue triangle"" or ""the triangle with the wavy fill"" or ""the blue object with the wavy fill"", they all uniquely identify the target object.

Given my understanding of potential ambiguity, and keeping in mind the need for brevity, I'm leaning toward ""**the triangle with the blue outline**"" because it combines shape and color effectively, making it a solid choice. I'm also considering ""**the triangle with the wavy fill**"" and ""**the blue triangle**"".

In summary, since there is a level of uncertainty, let's err on the side of caution. Let's make my final choice the most robust one that is also reasonably efficient.
"
exp2_057.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,triangle,blue,wavy,"3,1",It's a triangle with a blue outline and a gray wavy line pattern inside.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target**

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game, and my goal is clear: to get the other person to pick the right object. I'm the only one who can see the target, highlighted with a red box – a triangle in the top right of this 3x3 grid. I've got a specific job to do, and that's to make sure my partner knows what I see.

First, I assessed the scene. There's a 3x3 grid, some blank cells, some with objects, and some hidden behind these red curtains with question marks. The target is the key.

My immediate focus is on that target. It’s a triangle, and it’s got a blue outline and a grey wavy line pattern inside. The challenge is, there's another triangle in the grid, too, which has a blue outline but with a polka dot pattern. Those are the two I can *see*, at least. The others are hidden.

Now, my strategy starts to form. I need a description that's *unambiguous*. Since both triangles share the blue outline, I need to focus on the key differentiator – the pattern. So, the description has to be accurate and clear, and importantly, it can't rely on spatial terms like ""top-right,"" because their perspective could be different.

I played around with a few options in my head. I could have said, ""Select the triangle filled with wavy grey lines,"" or a more direct description like ""It's the triangle with the blue border and wavy gray lines inside, not the one with the dots.""

I concluded that the *most* effective way to be sure is to say, ""The object is a triangle with a blue outline and a gray wavy line pattern inside."" I think that's it! It's concise, it's specific, and it immediately distinguishes the target from the other object.
"
exp2_058.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,circle,green,dot,"3,3",It's a green circle filled with a pattern of grey dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game. My task is to describe this target object so someone else can pick it out. The target is highlighted, so that's the one I need to focus on. I can see it's a 3x3 grid, and some cells are empty or have objects. Crucially, I have to be careful about those cells hidden by the red and white curtain because my partner knows what's behind them, but I don't. I need to avoid any description that might apply to a hidden object.

First, I need to pinpoint the target: it's in the bottom-right cell, a green circle filled with little grey dots. The only other visible object is a star in the top-right. It's red and grey with a wavy pattern, so I need to make sure my description is different. Spatial references are out, so I can't say ""the one on the bottom right.""

I need to focus on the distinctive visual features: the green outline, the circle shape, and the grid of grey dots. ""Select the green circle."" is probably not enough, but it could be if there are no other circles hidden. I'm going to add that internal pattern to ensure the description is robust and unambiguous. The description has to be unique with respect to both the star and any possible hidden objects.

I'm thinking, ""It's a green circle filled with a pattern of grey dots"" would be an excellent description. It clearly distinguishes the target from the star, and the pattern of grey dots is specific enough to avoid confusion with possible objects. It's concise and precise, hitting all the key features. That should do the trick!
"
exp2_059.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,star,black,wavy,"2,1",It's the star with the wavy lines inside.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, here's how I'm thinking through this reference game. My objective is to give the best possible description of the target object so the listener can pinpoint it on the grid. I'm taking a systematic approach, considering all the visible elements and potential ambiguities.

First, I've analyzed the visual scene. I see a 3x3 grid. Some cells are empty, some have objects, and some are hidden behind red curtains with question marks. The target is clearly marked within a red dashed box, so I know exactly which element I need to focus on.

The target itself, located in the top middle position, is a five-pointed star with a bold black outline and filled with a gray pattern of horizontal wavy lines. I need to formulate a description that distinguishes it effectively from the other visible objects, especially since the listeners have access to all of the hidden information.

I've noted the other visible elements, which I'll call ""distractors."" There's a triangle in the top-left with the same wavy gray line pattern and thick black outline, and a square in the bottom-left with a blue outline and a vertical gray and white striped pattern. The right column cells are hidden, but the listener sees them. These are variables I have to account for.

The core of my approach is to identify the most salient differentiating features. Shape is the most obvious here: The target is a star, and the others are a triangle and a square. The pattern is shared between the target and triangle. While the color or outline could be good descriptors, I need to focus on shape first.

I considered several descriptions: ""The star,"" ""The star with wavy lines,"" and ""The star with the black outline."" ""The star"" is the simplest and best starting point. The wavy lines and thick black outline would distinguish it. ""The star with wavy lines inside and a black outline."" But that's a bit verbose.

The shape differentiates it from all the others. And it's not ambiguous with any hidden elements. So, ""The star"" is a good start. However, if there are multiple stars, and one has a different pattern, the simpler the descriptor, the better. To make it more clear, I could add the inner pattern as a backup: ""The star with the wavy lines inside"" is robust without becoming too verbose.

Ultimately, I've decided to prioritize a clear description based on what I can see. ""It's the star with the wavy lines"" is the final choice. It emphasizes the shape, then adds the detail to make sure the object is distinguishable, and it is robust in its description of the most prominent features.
"
exp2_060.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,circle,red,wavy,"2,1",It's a circle with a wavy pattern inside.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I need to act as the speaker in this reference game. My objective is to describe the object within that dashed red box so that it can be identified. Let's break this down systematically.

First, I'm analyzing the visual setup. It's a 3x3 grid, and I can see three objects: a circle with a wavy pattern (the target), a star with vertical stripes, and a square with a dotted pattern. They all have red borders. There are no hidden objects to worry about.

Now, I'm zeroing in on the target. It's a circle. It's got a thick red outline, and the key distinguishing feature here is the internal pattern: grey, wavy, horizontal lines.

Next, I'm identifying the distractors. The star has vertical stripes inside, and the square has a dotted pattern inside. All of them have a red border, so mentioning the color isn't going to help much.

To formulate the description, I need to focus on what makes the target unique. The shape (""circle"") and the internal pattern (""wavy lines"") are the defining features. I need to make sure my description distinguishes the target from the star and the square.

I'm thinking, ""The object is a circle with wavy lines inside."" That seems clear and unambiguous. Saying just ""The circle"" might work, but it's a bit too simple in case the listener needs more detail. Similarly, saying ""The object with wavy lines"" is good, but combining both is ideal. ""It's a circle with a grey wavy pattern inside and a red border."" seems robust. However, it's easier to say ""The circle with the wavy pattern.""

I've got to consider the constraints. ""Do not use degenerate spatial locations"" is important, but my description doesn't use any locations. And there aren't any hidden objects, so that doesn't apply here.

So, I need a concise, accurate, and unique description. The color information is redundant, since the color scheme is shared by all objects, so that can be dropped. The shape (circle) and pattern (wavy lines) are the essential characteristics.

I believe the best description is: **""The object is a circle with a wavy pattern inside.""** It's simple, accurate, and provides enough distinguishing information.
"
exp2_061.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,star,green,stripe,"2,1",The object is a star with a green outline and vertical stripes on the inside.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target**

Okay, so I've got a reference game to play. My task is to describe an object, and the user needs to select it from a grid. I need to be precise, but also as concise as possible. Let me break down my thought process:

First, I need to understand the visual information. I see a 3x3 grid, but only three cells are populated. The target is a green-outlined star with vertical gray stripes. There's also a red-outlined triangle with wavy gray and white stripes, and two cells with question marks. I have no idea what's behind those question marks, and that's the rub! I need to ensure my description is robust enough that those hidden objects *won't* make my target ambiguous.

My primary goal here is to create a unique description. My initial strategy is to identify features that differentiate the target: shape, outline color, and fill pattern. I consider, would ""The green star"" be enough? No, if one of those hidden objects has a similar form! ""The star with vertical stripes"" is a bit better, it's specific about the pattern. ""The green-outlined star filled with vertical gray stripes"" is the most robust, incorporating all distinguishing features.

I begin drafting descriptions and evaluating them. ""The green star"" might work *if* there's nothing else green. But what if there's a green circle? Or another green star with a different pattern? Then, this description fails.

So, I refine the descriptions. ""The star with vertical stripes"" is better, but what if something else has vertical stripes? The ""green-outlined star filled with vertical gray stripes"" is the most robust, but could it be more concise? Let's try, ""The green star with vertical stripes inside."" That seems to be a good balance of specificity and clarity.

I'm comparing the visible shapes to see what features can be relied upon. The triangle has a red outline and wavy stripes. The star has a green outline and vertical stripes. Either could be relied upon. Would a simple ""The object with a green outline"" work? No, there could be other green objects. ""The star""? Potentially not unique. ""The object with vertical stripes""? Again, possibly not. Combining features is the safest. ""The green star"" (color and shape), ""the star with vertical stripes"" (shape and pattern), ""The green object with vertical stripes"" (color and pattern).

The most distinguishing features are its shape (star), outline color (green), and pattern (vertical stripes). So using ""green star"" is a strong candidate, using two strong identifiers. ""The star with vertical stripes"" is also a good candidate. But combining these two – ""The green star with vertical stripes"" – is the safest, most unambiguous option.

Finally, I formulate the utterance. I want to convey shape, outline color, and the inner pattern. ""Select the green star that has vertical stripes inside it."" I could also say, ""It's the green star with vertical stripes,"" or ""The object is a star with a green outline and vertical stripes on the inside."" I'm going to keep it simple, clear, and direct: ""The green star with vertical stripes."" It's concise and covers the key unique features. I think that will do it.
"
exp2_062.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,square,green,dot,"2,3",It's the square.,"**My Thought Process: Decoding the Reference Game**

Okay, here's the deal. I'm being asked to play this reference game, and my role is speaker. The goal? Describe an object so clearly that someone else can pick it out, even with other stuff around. Time to break it down.

First, I need to *really* analyze the target. It's inside a red dashed box - a visual cue to the listener that will make it immediately obvious what I'm talking about, though this is only for my benefit, the listener won't be able to see the box. It's a square. Okay, that's a key piece of information. The outline is green, and the fill pattern is a grid of grey dots. Got it.

Next, the distractors. I'm checking out the other objects because I have to build a description that *uniquely* identifies the target. Top-left: circle, black outline, grey dots. Top-middle: triangle, red outline, grey vertical stripes. Middle-left: circle, blue outline, grey wavy lines. Middle-right: triangle, green outline, grey dots. Bottom-left, Top-right, Bottom-right: empty.

Now, let's craft that winning description. Shape is huge. The target is a square, and none of the other objects are. That's a strong, clean descriptor. Okay, let's explore this. The outline is green, but the triangle in the middle-right *also* has a green outline. ""The green one"" would be confusing, but ""the green square"" is not. Then, the target has grey dots, but the top-left circle and the middle-right triangle have dots too. So, ""the one with dots"" would be ambiguous, but ""the square with dots"" is clear.

So, how can I combine these features to be both efficient *and* unambiguous? ""The square"" is sufficient, concise. ""The green square"" is nice; adds color, which is redundant but helpful for confirmation. ""The square with a green border and filled with grey dots"" is the most detailed and unambiguous.

I need to remember any constraints: no spatial language (avoiding descriptions like ""the one at the bottom""). The other person might see things that I don't. That means I need to be as specific as possible to avoid confusion, to account for potential hidden objects.

The best description: ""The square."" That's the most efficient and unique descriptor. Let's make sure, what are the other objects? Circle, triangle, and the other objects share the colors and the pattern, but nothing else is a square.

Target: Green square with dots. Distractors: black circle, red triangle, blue circle, green triangle. Is there any other square? No. Any other green object? Yes. Is there any other object with dots? Yes. Therefore, ""The square"" is fine.

The final messages: ""The square with the green border"", or ""It's the green square."" ""It's the square"", or even ""The square with a green outline"".

I'm checking the properties again. Shape, color, and pattern. The most distinguishing feature is the shape. So I should definitely mention that. ""It's the square"" - this is minimal and correct. Adding more features can only help me. If there are other features, like color or pattern.

Is there any ambiguity with just ""the square""? No, there are no other squares. But...what if the listener sees a square I *don't* see? I have to consider hidden objects here. If there was a hidden object, and it was a square, then ""the square"" would be ambiguous. And so on. So ""the green square filled with dots"" is the most specific. ""The square"", ""The green square"", ""The square with dots"", and finally, ""The green square with dots"". This is the safest bet.

Let's break it down: ""the square"": distinguishes from the circles and triangles. ""green"": distinguishes from the black circle and red triangle. ""filled with dots"": distinguishes from the red triangle (stripes) and blue circle (waves). This is the most robust.

However, maybe it's too much? I'm trying to be efficient but also unambiguous. ""The green shape with dots that is a square."" - no, it's clunky.

I'm considering it. The most critical feature is the shape. The most efficient and unambiguous instruction is simply ""The square."" Any additional information is technically redundant given the visible objects. However, considering the possibility of hidden objects for me, adding more features is safer.

Let's go with a combination that is both concise and descriptive.
""Select the green square."" It uses color and shape.
""Select the square"

Okay, the task is a reference game. I need to describe this target object so the listener can pick it out from the grid. Let's analyze. It's a 3x3 grid with three visible objects: a black triangle with dots, a green square with vertical stripes, and a red triangle with vertical stripes—that's the target. The target is highlighted by a red dashed box.

I need a description that's unique.  ""The triangle"" won't work, there are two.  ""The object with stripes"" is out, the green square has the same feature. ""The red object"" *might* work, but it's good to be more specific. I could go with ""the red triangle"", distinguishing by both color and shape. Or ""the triangle with vertical stripes"", which specifies shape and pattern. I think ""the red triangle with vertical stripes"" is very precise, and is robust because it specifies shape, color, and fill pattern.

Now, let's explore if I can be more concise. If I only specify ""red object,"" it *should* work, because the other objects are black and green, but it is better to avoid any risk of error. If I use ""the object with vertical stripes,"" it is unique from the other object (the black triangle). So how about ""the red triangle""? It sounds good and is brief. If I say ""the triangle with vertical stripes"" it is also unambiguous.  Between the two, ""the red triangle"" is shorter and seems to be the most unambiguous.

Ultimately, I'll go with ""the red triangle."" It's simple, direct, and eliminates ambiguity in this context.

exp2_064.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,star,red,dot,"1,2",Select the star that is filled with polka dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My task is to describe this target object so someone else can pick it out from a set of distractors. It's a star, highlighted by a red dashed box, but I can't mention the box. I need to focus on what makes this specific star *unique*.

First, I analyze the object itself: it's a star with a red outline and a grey polka dot fill on a white background. Got it. Now, I have to consider the distractors—three other objects with different shapes, colors, and fills: a green-outlined, wavy-filled triangle; a blue-outlined, wavy-filled triangle; and a blue-outlined, polka-dot-filled square.

My initial thought is ""the red star"". But is *that* enough? I check: is there another star? No. Another red object? No. Okay, that sounds promising. It's concise. But, let's explore all options, for robustness.

Could I use the polka dots? The target is a polka-dot-filled star. Hmm, the square is also polka-dotted, so that's not uniquely descriptive on its own. It seems I would need to specify the shape: ""the star with polka dots"".

What about the red outline? Yes, the star has a red outline, and the other objects have green or blue outlines, so ""the object with the red outline"" *is* unique.

And the shape? ""The star"" by itself *is* unique. I am getting the sense that this is the best, simple answer.

Comparing them, ""the star"" is the simplest and most effective. ""The object with the red outline"" also works. ""The star with polka dots"" is effective, but a bit more complex. Let me go with ""The star"".

However, I should be extra sure and be robust. Let's combine shape and fill pattern. I'll describe it as ""The star with polka dots"". This ensures uniqueness compared to the triangles with wavy lines and the square with polka dots. This feels rock-solid. Let's evaluate again.

Target: Red star, polka dot fill. Distractors: green triangle/wavy, blue triangle/wavy, blue square/polka dots. Let's run a quick uniqueness check again:

*   Shape ""star"": Unique.
*   Outline color ""red"": Unique.
*   Fill pattern ""polka dots"": Not unique (shared with the blue square).
*   Fill pattern ""wavy lines"": Not unique (shared by both triangles).

So shape and color are the simplest unique features. A combination is also good. Okay, considering the instructions (""do not use degenerate spatial locations"") I'm good. ""The star"" is the most direct. But ""the star with polka dots"" is also great, using multiple features to ensure further robustness. 

Let me re-phrase it, contrasting the target with the distractors. ""There is only one star, select that one."" Also good! Also very simple. Or ""There is only one object with a red outline, select that one.""

All these point to the same object. The simplest instruction is ""The star"". Let's stick with my combined description ""The star with polka dots."" Since I can safely combine these two features that uniquely identify this object.

It's clear, unambiguous. I'm going with ""The star with polka dots"".

exp2_065.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,square,blue,checker,"3,2",It's a grey and white checkerboard pattern inside of a blue frame.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, here's how I'm approaching this reference game. My primary objective is to describe an object within a 3x3 grid, allowing the listener to identify it without any spatial cues that might be listener-dependent.

1.  **Understand the Setup:** I'm seeing a grid where some cells are visible and some are obscured by question-mark curtains. The listener sees *everything*, but I don't. That means I have to be precise and avoid anything that might apply to a hidden object.

2.  **Object Inventory:** I need to catalog what *I* can see:
    *   A covered cell.
    *   A star with a red outline and grey wavy interior.
    *   Two empty cells.
    *   A checkerboard pattern with a blue frame, and that's the *target* (indicated by a dashed box).
    *   And another covered cell.

3.  **Target ID:** So, the target is a checkerboard pattern with a blue frame.

4.  **Description Dilemma:** I can't say, ""the one in the middle row on the right"" – the arrangement might be different for the listener. I have to focus on *what it is*, not *where it is* relative to my current viewpoint.

5.  **Target Features:** It's a square. It has a blue border. And it contains a grey and white checkerboard pattern.

6.  **Comparisons:** The star is easily distinguished by its shape, pattern, and color. The curtains are completely different.

7.  **Hidden Object Worries:** This is the tricky part. The description must be specific enough to distinguish *even* from an unseen object. I need to use the combined features that make this target unique. The blue frame and the grey and white checkerboard are quite a specific combination.

8.  **Initial Drafts:** I started playing around with descriptions:
    *   ""It's a square with a blue border."" (Maybe too general)
    *   ""It's a checkerboard pattern."" (Too general)
    *   ""It's a square with a blue border, and inside it is a grey and white checkerboard pattern."" (This is getting there, but it's a bit wordy).

9.  **Refinement:** I'm looking for clarity and conciseness:
    *   ""The object with the blue frame and the grey and white checkerboard pattern inside."" (Better, but still a little clunky).
    *   ""It's a grey and white checkerboard inside a blue square frame."" (This is concise).
    *   ""Select the checkerboard with the blue border."" (Good, but I'm trying to be more descriptive).

10. **Final Assessment:**
    *   Does it accurately describe the target? Yes.
    *   Does it avoid spatial references? Yes.
    *   Is it distinct from the visible star? Yes.
    *   Is it likely distinct from hidden objects? Yes, the combined features of the pattern and frame color should work.

    I'm going with: ""The object is a grey and white checkerboard with a blue frame."" It's concise, accurate, and highlights the defining characteristics of the target.

exp2_066.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,circle,black,dot,"1,1",The circle filled with dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with acting as the speaker in a reference game. My objective is clear: describe the object within the dashed red box in a way that someone else can pinpoint it. I need to be precise and unambiguous, avoiding any ambiguity.

First, I need to break down the target object's characteristics. I've got to consider shape, outline color, and fill pattern, excluding its location within the grid. So, it's a circle, with a black outline, and filled with a grid of grey dots. Simple enough.

Now, I look at the distractors. I analyze each object to identify key differentiators. The other objects are: a striped triangle with a black outline, a circle with a blue outline and a wavy fill, a dotted-fill star with a blue outline, and a dotted-fill triangle with a blue outline, and empty middle row.

Now comes the crucial part: formulating a description that uniquely identifies the target. Simply saying ""the circle"" won't cut it; there's another circle in the mix. ""The one with the black outline"" is tempting, but the top-middle triangle also has a black outline. ""The one with the dots"" narrows it down, but the star and the other triangle also have dots. So, I need to combine these features.

The descriptions are going to include combinations of shape and color/pattern:

*   ""The circle with dots inside"" - Sounds good, differentiates it from the wavy circle and the non-circles.
*   ""The circle with the black outline"" - Equally effective, the other circle has a blue outline.
*   ""The black-outlined object with dots"" - Also works, because there's only one black outline.

I've got a few strong contenders now. I need to consider brevity and clarity. Let's evaluate them: ""The circle with dots inside"" is concise. ""The circle with the black outline"" is also good. ""The black-outlined object with dots"" is also fine. Let's aim for simplicity, the fill is more salient than the color.

I'm thinking ""the circle with the black outline"" or ""the circle filled with dots"".

Now for a final check: I mentally re-check against all the distractors to make sure my choice is sound. Is the target a circle? Yes. Is it filled with dots? Yes. Is any other object a circle *filled* with dots? Nope. The other circle has wavy lines, and the other dotted shapes are a star and a triangle. My description uniquely identifies the target.

I could say ""The circle with the black outline"", but ""the circle filled with dots"" is more definitive. The fill pattern seems more distinctive. I could also combine the traits, but I think that is unnecessary. ""The circle filled with dots"" works best. It is concise, and accurate. That is the one!

exp2_067.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,square,blue,wavy,"2,1",The square with the wavy pattern that has a blue border.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I need to describe a specific object in a grid so someone else can identify it. This is essentially a reference game, and I need to be precise. Let's break this down systematically.

First, I see the grid is mostly empty, but the top-left section is populated. There are two hidden objects in cells (1,1) and (2,1) - red curtains with question marks. I can't use these to differentiate since I don't know what's behind them, and I can't *see* behind them.

The red dashed box highlights my target: cell (1,2). It's a square with a white wavy line pattern on a gray background and a solid blue border. Now, I need to look at what's directly visible to compare it with.

In cell (2,3), there's a very similar object: a square with the same wavy pattern and gray background. The key difference is the border! This one has a solid *red* border. So, these are the two things I'm concerned with differentiating.

The hidden objects are just that – hidden. So, the only competing item to consider is the object with the red border.

Since the internal patterns are the same, my description has to focus on what's different: the border color. I need to make the *blue* border clear and salient. I can't mention the red dashed box because only I can see it.

Therefore, the best approach is to focus on that key distinction. I'll need to say something that includes both the pattern and the unique border. I don't need to specify the position. My options are:

*   ""The object with the blue border."" - This is a bit vague.
*   ""The square with the wavy pattern that has a blue border."" - This is clear and descriptive.
*   ""The gray square with the white wavy lines has a blue border."" - This is good too.

Ultimately, I'll go with ""The square with the wavy pattern and the blue border."" It's direct, accurate, and highlights the crucial difference.

exp2_068.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,star,black,stripe,"2,1",It's the star with the black outline.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. The goal is to describe an object, the one within the red box, in a way that another person can identify it without actually seeing it. Let's break this down systematically.

First, I need to *thoroughly* analyze the target. It's a five-pointed star, that's immediately clear. Its outline is black, and the interior is filled with vertical stripes in gray and white. I'll need to remember those details – shape, outline color, and internal pattern.

Next, I have to consider the context. What else is visible? I see a green-outlined triangle with grey dots, another five-pointed star with a blue outline and grey/white vertical stripes (like my target, but *blue*), and a red-outlined triangle with a grey and white checkerboard. There are also two hidden objects behind red curtains with question marks. I have no information on the hidden objects.

Now, formulating the description is the crucial step. I have to distinguish my target star from *all* the other objects, especially the other visible star. Both stars share vertical stripes – so that won't be sufficient to distinguish between them. The outline color *is* the key difference. My star has a black outline, while the other has a blue outline. I'll need to lead with that. Then, I can mention that it's a star to set it apart from the two triangles.

I've drafted a few descriptions: ""It's a star with a black outline,"" ""It's the star with vertical stripes and a black border,"" and ""It's a black-outlined star with grey and white vertical stripes inside."" The challenge is to be concise yet unambiguous.

Let's refine. The black outline is the salient feature compared to the other visible star. The pattern might be necessary given the hidden objects. However, my most direct comparison is the outline. I'm going to consider edge cases. Let's say one of the hidden objects *is* a black-outlined star – but with a different internal pattern. I cannot *see* the hidden object. The visible items are my reference.

Considering the hidden elements, I might need to make my description more robust. Shape (""star"") alone isn't enough, since there are other stars. Both stars have vertical stripes, which won't distinguish.

So, here's my plan:

1.  Identify shape: ""star.""
2.  Highlight the differentiating feature: ""black outline.""
3.  Add the pattern to be safe against hidden objects: ""vertical stripes.""

This gives me the description: ""It's a star with a black outline and vertical stripes."" However, after considering all the possible variations, I believe that ""It's the star with a black outline"" is the simplest and most effective description. It leverages the contrast of the blue outline on the other star. Therefore, I will use: ""It's the star with a black outline.""
"
exp2_069.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,2,square,green,dot,"1,1",Select the square that is filled with dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object within this 3x2 grid so that another person can select it accurately. First, I need to analyze the visual scene. I see three distinct objects, and the target is clearly marked within a red dashed box. Let's start with the grid itself: it's a 3x3 grid, though only a 3x2 section is populated with objects.

My task is to disregard spatial location cues, which seems to be a standard instruction in this type of game. Also, I need to ignore instructions related to ""red curtains"" because there aren't any.

Now, let's break down the objects:
*   **The Target:** It's a square, with a green solid border, and filled with a pattern of grey dots.
*   **Distractor 1:** A triangle with a blue border, also filled with grey dots.
*   **Distractor 2:** A rectangle with a blue border, and a grey wavy pattern filling it.

I need a description that uniquely identifies the target. My mind immediately considers the features of the target object – the shape, border color, and fill pattern. I have to avoid ambiguity. The other two objects are the key elements to compare the target against. ""The green border"" seems like a strong differentiator since the other two shapes have blue borders. So, ""the object with the green border"" is a viable description.

However, let's explore other options. If I focus on shape, I can say ""the square,"" but I see the other shape may be more rectangular so ""the square"" is still a reasonable descriptor. If I go for fill pattern, I could say ""the dotted object,"" but the triangle is also filled with dots. So that's not uniquely identifying either. Therefore, I can combine features: ""the square with the green border"". This seems very robust.

I'm aiming for simplicity and clarity. ""The square with the green border"" sounds like a solid choice, combining a shape (square) and a color (green) that is unique to the target. But ""the dotted square"" works too, the triangle is also a dotted object, but it is not a square. Therefore, the phrase ""the dotted square"" is also a good descriptor. ""The green square"" is good too! It gets the correct information across.

""The square with the green border that's filled with grey dots"" is very descriptive, but perhaps too verbose. I want to keep it efficient. However, after considering all the options, ""the dotted square"" is very good, it stands in direct contrast to ""the dotted triangle"" and ""the wavy rectangle.""

Let's summarize.
*   Shape: Square
*   Fill: Dots
*   Other Objects: The triangle (dots) and the rectangle (waves)

Ultimately, ""the square filled with dots"" is the best way to uniquely describe the target because it contrasts well with the triangle (different shape) and the rectangle (different shape and pattern). It's precise and unambiguous.

exp2_070.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,square,green,checker,"1,3",Select the square object that has a green outline and a checkerboard pattern inside.,"**Analyzing and Describing the Target Object for Identification**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My task is to describe this target object clearly enough that someone else can pick it out, even if they see the environment differently. I need to be precise, avoiding any location-based descriptions that might not transfer. There are potentially hidden elements, which adds a layer of complexity.

First, I see the highlighted object. It's in the bottom left, which I note, but won't use. It's a square, that's crucial. The outline is solid green – a key visual characteristic. Inside the square is a checkerboard pattern of grey and white squares.

Now, I look at the distractors to see how I can differentiate the target object. In the top left, there's a circle with a thick black outline and a checkerboard pattern. Middle right has a red-outlined star with wavy lines inside. The bottom middle is another red-outlined circle, but it also has the checkerboard pattern. The bottom right is a black-outlined circle with grey and white stripes. I'm noting the empty cells too, just in case something might be hidden, as per the instructions, and visible to the other player.

My strategy is to find the *unique* features that distinguish the target from everything else. A square is the only square. That's a strong start. The green outline is also unique. Two other objects have the checkerboard pattern, so that by itself isn't enough.

So, the simplest description might be ""The square."" or ""The object with the green outline."" Both are clear. I'm considering potential ambiguity in case there are hidden objects. Let's see... a square with a *green* outline and a checkerboard pattern. That's pretty specific. I can exclude the other checkerboard objects, which are circles. The other objects are all circles, apart from the star, so this is important!

Looking again at the features, shape and outline color are the most effective. No other object has both properties. Now to formulate the best description. I'll need to be concise yet unambiguous.

I could say, ""Select the square"" or ""Select the object with the green outline."" Both are good. To be even more robust in case of hidden elements, I want to describe both.

Let's compare the features: shape (square), outline color (green), and pattern (checkerboard). Shape and outline color are unique, the pattern is not. ""The square,"" or ""The green outline"" will suffice. Let's combine for the safest approach to describe the object as a whole: the square and the color and a pattern: ""The green square with a checkerboard pattern."" This covers all bases and is unique among the visible objects.

The object is a square with a green border and a checkerboard pattern inside.
I'll describe it as: ""The green square with a checkerboard pattern.""

exp2_071.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,square,black,checker,"1,2",Select the checkerboard that has a black border.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My task is to describe the target object, which in this case is a checkerboard pattern. Let's break this down systematically.

First, I see a 3x2 grid. Some cells are empty, but the ones that *do* have content are what I need to focus on. There's a red curtain with a question mark in the top-left and another at the bottom-left – effectively hidden objects for me. The middle-left cell houses the checkerboard pattern that's the target, and finally, bottom-right has another checkerboard. The target is helpfully indicated by a red dashed line.

The immediate challenge is to distinguish the target. The target is a checkerboard pattern with a black border. This is critical. The distracting checkerboard has a green border. This is the key. My initial thought of simply saying ""the checkerboard pattern"" is immediately insufficient; I need a *specific* descriptor.

Now, those curtains are tempting. The listener *does* know what's behind them, but I *don't*. Therefore, I can't rely on comparing the target to whatever's hidden unless I account for the uncertainty itself as an attribute of the target. To formulate an unambiguous description, I need to focus on what I *can* see and what distinguishes the target from other *visible* objects.

I considered location-based descriptions, but that's risky. ""The checkerboard in the middle"" might not be accurate or clear from the listener's perspective. It's better to stick with what's guaranteed.

So, the black border is the primary differentiator. I'm now thinking: the *black* border is essential.

I will also consider alternative wording: ""The checkered square that has a black frame"" or ""Select the checkerboard pattern that is outlined in black."" But ""the checkerboard with the black border"" is the most concise and effective.

Does it rely on spatial location? No. Is it based on what *I* can see? Yes. Does it distinguish the target from other *visible* objects? Absolutely. It clearly separates it from the checkerboard with the green border. That's the best I can do, given my limited information. The black border is the key descriptor here.

exp2_072.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,star,black,stripe,"3,2",Select the star that is filled with vertical stripes.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I need to act as a speaker in this reference game. My objective is to describe the target object clearly so the other person can identify it correctly. Let me break down my thought process.

First, I'm analyzing the visual setup. I see a 3x3 grid with some filled and some empty cells. There are two cells with red curtains obscuring objects, and importantly, I know the listener *can* see what's behind those curtains. The target is highlighted for *me* with a red dashed box, which I need to ignore in my description. The target is a five-pointed star with a thick black outline and vertical grey and white stripes inside. There's also a circle at the bottom right with a red outline and grey dots on a white background.

My primary task is identifying the target. It's the striped star. Now comes the trick: formulating a description that uniquely identifies the target, and that will work whether the listener can see the image or not. I've got to focus on visual properties that *distinguish* it. The arrangement in the grid doesn't matter, so I'm avoiding location references.

I'm zeroing in on key visual features. The shape is a star, it has a black outline, and a unique pattern: vertical grey and white stripes. The other visible object is a circle with a red outline and a dot pattern inside. Those dot patterns are crucial for differentiation.

I'm now drafting descriptions. ""Select the star."" Might work if it’s the only star. ""Select the object with a black outline."" The circle has a red outline, so this could work. ""Select the object with vertical stripes."" The circle has dots, this will do the trick! Combining features would be safer: ""Select the star that has vertical stripes inside and a black outline."" Now I'm considering each of them.

Now I am going over the components and considering the most distinct features. The shape (star) and the internal pattern (vertical stripes) are the most significant differentiators. The color of the outline (black) is also a good characteristic.

I'm thinking: how can I be concise but unambiguous? ""The object is a star with vertical stripes inside."" Or ""It's a star with a black outline and a striped pattern."" ""It's the five-pointed star with grey and white vertical stripes."" Very specific. However, I want a nice, short description.

Mentioning the shape (star) is the most direct identifier. The pattern (stripes) uniquely differentiates it.

""It's the star with vertical stripes."" seems good. But could there be another star with a different pattern? Or an object with stripes but a different shape? Yes. So I'm thinking about combining shape and pattern. Shape and pattern are the safest bet.

My final plan: describe the shape (star), describe the internal pattern (vertical stripes) and combine them into a clear sentence. Avoid location. Do not mention the red dashed box.

""Select the star that is filled with vertical stripes.""
This *feels* right. It's clear, descriptive, and I'm not using any information that the other person doesn't have. I feel confident.

exp2_073.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,star,green,stripe,"3,2",Select the star with the green outline and vertical stripes inside.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm in a reference game. My task is to describe an object, the ""target,"" in a way that allows another person to identify it from their view, which might differ from mine. I've got to think like a seasoned communicator in the field of visual description. Here's how I'm approaching this:

First, I'm taking stock. I see a 3x3 grid. Some cells are empty, some hold objects, and some are covered by red curtains with question marks. I understand the curtains indicate hidden information for me, but the other person can see behind them. This immediately tells me I need to be careful with assumptions.

Next, I need to isolate the relevant objects. For me, I see a star with a black outline and a checkerboard pattern, the red curtains, and the *target*: a star with a green outline and vertical grey and white stripes. I should note that I have a red dashed box around the target star, but that is only relevant to my view.

I'm focused on the target object – the green-outlined, vertically striped star. It's crucial that my description accurately and unambiguously differentiates it from the other visible star. This means my description must be independent of its location, or assumptions about other objects. My goal is to craft a description that will work *no matter what else the other person can see*.

I have a few approaches in mind, as I am trying to use a process of elimination:

1.  I could just say, ""the star with the green outline"". But what if the person can see *another* green star? The curtain is a potential problem in this regard.
2.  I could be direct, but simple, ""the star with a green outline and vertical stripes inside"". It's a precise description.
3.  I could be slightly more conversational, maybe even more descriptive, and say, ""Select the star that has a green outline and is filled with vertical stripes.""

The key here is not just describing the object but comparing it to the other relevant one to ensure clarity. I need to make the *distinction* clear. For instance, I might say ""The other star has a black border and a checkerboard pattern,"" to ensure there is no confusion. I will stick to what I can see and describe the target with the goal of being both correct, and robust.

Given all of this, I think I'll go with the second version: ""Select the star that has a green outline and is filled with vertical stripes."" It's specific and eliminates potential ambiguity.

exp2_074.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,square,black,wavy,"1,3",The square with the wavy pattern.,"**My Thought Process: Describing a Visual Target**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object within this 3x3 grid so that another person can identify it correctly. I need to be precise, but also efficient. I'm going to break this down methodically.

First, I need to *analyze the image* completely. It's a grid, and there are four clearly visible objects. I can see a star, a triangle, and two squares. The target object is one of the squares—the one in the bottom-left corner with the red dashed box around it. I need to note the unique features of each object, because those are the elements that will make up my description.

Now, I *identify the target object* features. It's a square, obviously. It also has a black border and a grey, wavy, scalloped pattern inside. The other items are: a star with dots, a triangle with vertical stripes, and a square with a checkerboard pattern and a red border.

Then, *identify the other objects*. I need a clear mental list of each distractor. That way, I can craft a clear, concise description.

I'm ready to *formulate a description* for the target. First, I focus on the shape – a square. Hmm, there's *another* square! So, 'square' alone won't do. I need to add more detail. The internal pattern is clearly the standout feature here, as it's the most distinct visual differentiator from the others. The black border is also a differentiator. I need to avoid ambiguity.

My mind is now *drafting different descriptions*. First, just the basics: ""The object is a square with a wavy pattern inside."" That works. ""The object has a thick black border and a wavy pattern"" is good too. Or maybe, something simple: ""The square with the wavy lines"" is direct. And ""The square with the black border"" is accurate but incomplete.

Now, I'm *refining the description*. I need to focus on what *doesn't* work, as well as what will. I need to make sure to avoid spatial terms – so no ""bottom-left"" or anything. I need to be precise enough that the listener can distinguish the target from *all* the other objects, known or unknown. Since there aren't any hidden objects in this image, I'm only working with what's visible. I'll compare the features. My target is: square, wavy pattern, black border. The distractor square is: square, checkerboard pattern, red border. Okay, so a few options here: ""The square with the wavy pattern"" is clear. ""The square with the black border"" could work. But I want to combine them for maximum clarity.

*Constructing the final description* comes next. I think I'll start with the shape: ""There are two squares."" I need to get the listener's attention! Then, I'll clarify: ""...I'm referring to the one…"" “…with the wavy pattern inside.” That really pops. Then: ""...that has a black border."" The combined version is: ""Select the square that has a wavy pattern inside and a black border."" Too long? I could simplify, “The square with the wavy pattern.” That's likely sufficient since it's the most unique pattern.

I know I need to consider all the shapes. The star has dots, and the triangle has stripes. The patterns are all different. So describing the pattern alone is a strong option. Now, the description “The square with the wavy lines inside"" is concise and unambiguous. But, I'll go with the most salient, unique feature. The wavy pattern is very distinct. So now I have: ""It's the square filled with wavy lines"" or ""The square with the wavy pattern.""

Let's check the borders again. Target has a black border. Checkerboard square has a red border. It's a strong feature. I've now got: ""The square with the black border"" and ""The square with the wavy pattern.""

Both are valid and effective descriptions. But, I think I'll go with a combo of shape and pattern. It's concise, accurate, and unambiguous. So finally, I've got:

""The square with the wavy pattern inside.""

That's perfect.

exp2_075.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,star,red,wavy,"3,2",It's the star with the wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My goal is to craft a description of a target object within this 3x3 grid that's clear enough for someone to identify it without any ambiguity. Let's break down how I'll approach this.

First, I need to analyze what's in front of me. I see three distinct objects: a triangle in the top-left, a square in the middle-left, and a star in the middle-right. The star is my target. The image provides the following information: The target object is a star, with a red border and grey and white wavy pattern inside. The distractor objects are a red-bordered triangle with a checkered pattern, and a black-bordered square with a vertical striped pattern.

The first crucial step is to zero in on the unique features of the target object that will differentiate it from the distractors. I'm thinking: What makes the star stand out? Its shape (a five-pointed star) is key. The border color is shared with the triangle. The fill patterns are different among the items. The shape is the strongest differentiating factor.

So, I have to form a description that uniquely identifies the star. I can't use spatial location as a distinguishing factor; I need to focus on intrinsic features. Considering this constraint, I'm thinking, ""The star"" is a simple and effective start. But I want to make sure it's unambiguous. 

The fill patterns are different - checkered, striped, and wavy - and I can use this. ""The object with a wavy pattern"" is unique. Combining features, I could say, ""The star with a wavy pattern."" This is a strong starting point and can be robust. I can also say, ""The object is a star with a red border and a wavy gray and white pattern inside."" This is very detailed, perhaps overly so. However, it's comprehensive.

I need to focus on clarity and conciseness, so let's weigh the features. The shape is unique. The border color is shared with the triangle. The pattern is different across all the shapes. I am looking for the simplest and the most robust description. I'm now leaning towards a phrase that combines shape and the pattern: ""The star with the wavy pattern."" That’s short, to the point, and highly specific. The adjective ""wavy"" is perfect - it clearly describes that particular visual pattern. The colors don't need to be mentioned, as they are shared. The border color (red) is not, as the triangle has that border too.

Finally, let's refine this, focusing on clarity. ""The object is a star with a wavy pattern inside."" ""It's the star with the wavy fill pattern."" ""The star with wavy lines inside.""

Let's stick with the shape and pattern combination, as this works. My final thought is: ""The star with the wavy pattern."" That’s a good, complete description. I will refine it for conversational flow. So, ""It's the star with the wavy pattern inside."" I am now ready.

exp2_076.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,triangle,green,stripe,"1,3",The triangle with vertical stripes inside.,"**My Thought Process for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My goal is to describe a specific object on this grid so someone else can pick it out. Let's break this down.

First, I see a 3x3 grid with three visible objects: a green-outlined triangle with vertical grey stripes, a green-outlined square with grey dots, and a red-outlined star with a checkerboard pattern. The target is the triangle with vertical stripes, and it's helpfully highlighted for *me* with a dashed red box – which the other person *won't* see. I need to describe it in a way that’s independent of any spatial relationships like ""top left,"" since their arrangement could be different.

Next, I need to identify what *uniquely* identifies the target. It's a triangle, which is a good starting point because that eliminates the square and star. Its outline is green, which isn't unique, because the square has one too. The internal pattern, vertical grey stripes, *is* unique because the others have dots and a checkerboard. The key is finding features that are distinct.

Now, I'm thinking about how to phrase the description. I could just say ""The triangle,"" but that feels a little *too* simple, especially considering there might be hidden objects. Even though the instructions say ""the other person knows"" what's behind the curtain, I need to make sure my description is precise enough to distinguish my target from any potentially hidden objects. I'm imagining hidden triangles of different colors or patterns. So, I also need to consider those possibilities.

I can make it more clear by combining its unique features. ""The green triangle with vertical grey stripes inside"" is very clear, but maybe a bit long-winded. I could go with ""The triangle with vertical stripes,"" which seems concise and unambiguous in this specific scenario. It's concise, but precise. The shape and the pattern are the core unique elements. The color is important, but a hidden object might also be green. So, I consider the color but I want to stay focused on what will be absolutely helpful. ""The triangle with vertical stripes inside"" is the most robust and clear.

I have to choose the best description that's both concise and informative. ""The triangle with vertical stripes"" is simple enough, and uniquely identifies the object. Yes, I'll go with that.

exp2_077.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,circle,blue,stripe,"1,3",It's the circle with vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game. My objective is to describe the target object within this 3x3 grid so that another person can select it accurately. First, I need to analyze the image, which is a 3x3 grid containing various shapes and patterns. The target is in the bottom-left corner – it’s a circle with a blue outline and filled with grey vertical stripes. Now, I need to take the other visible objects (the distractors) into account when formulating my description to make sure I'm unambiguous. There are also two red curtains with question marks. The person I'm describing the target to can see what's behind them, and I cannot.

I'm focused on the most distinctive visual features of the target: the fact that it is a circle with vertical stripes. The others are triangles, and the patterns are dots and wavy lines. The key is to craft a description that's robust, taking into account potentially hidden objects behind the curtains. A basic description like ""the circle"" might be ambiguous if there is another hidden circle.

Therefore, I'm thinking I must combine multiple attributes. For instance, ""the blue-outlined circle"" is better. However, a description like ""the circle with vertical stripes"" is even more specific and has a strong chance of being unique. The shape of a circle is important, and the vertical stripes help identify it.

I'm evaluating options now: ""The circle with vertical stripes"" is a good candidate. ""The blue circle"" might work, but it would not work if there was another blue-outlined circle with a different pattern. ""The object with vertical stripes"" has less ambiguity, but what if there's a triangle with the same pattern. Combining features is usually safest: ""The circle with the blue outline."" is also very robust, but maybe there's a similar shape with a different pattern. ""The circle with vertical stripes"" is both concise and strong. ""The blue-outlined object with vertical stripes"" is also a strong choice, but potentially verbose.

The final strategy is: what if I create an unambiguous description using the strongest combination of features? The target object is a circle. The target also has vertical stripes. A good description would be: ""The object is a circle filled with vertical stripes."" I consider a few final options, looking at shapes, outlines, and fill patterns. I want to minimize ambiguity. Combining key features is the safest strategy, and I arrive at the best description: ""The object is a circle filled with vertical stripes"".

exp2_078.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,triangle,red,stripe,"2,1",It's the triangle with the red outline.,"**Analysis and Description of Target Object**

Okay, so I'm presented with an image and need to give a descriptive clue to identify a specific target object, a classic reference game scenario. First, I mentally break down the image: a 3x3 grid, though some cells are merged. The red-outlined triangle with vertical stripes in the top middle cell is the target. I need to convey its identity in a way that’s unambiguous, considering that other objects are in view, and some are hidden behind a curtain.

My immediate thought is to zero in on distinguishing features. Shape is important: it's a triangle. Outline: red. Fill: vertical gray stripes. The other visible objects are a green-outlined triangle with the same fill, a green-outlined square with dots, and a black-outlined star with the same stripes. I need to make the *least* number of assumptions and *most* clarity possible.

First I evaluate the differences and similar features. The other objects are: the green triangle (same shape and fill but different outline), the green square (different shape, fill, and outline), and the star (different shape and outline, but same fill).

I’m immediately aware of the potential for ambiguity because there is a hidden element behind the curtain, I need to choose a description that holds true regardless of what's hidden, and I need to avoid degenerate locations.

I considered a few options. ""It's the red triangle"" is simple but might fail if there's another red triangle hidden. ""It's the triangle with the red outline"" is more precise, making the color placement explicit. ""The object filled with vertical stripes that has a red outline"" is robust, distinguishing from the star. The best is ""There are two triangles filled with vertical stripes. I'm referring to the one with the red outline."" This acknowledges the ambiguity and resolves it.

Ultimately, I lean toward focusing on *the most important* difference between the target and the most similar distractors, which is the other triangle that shares the same fill pattern but has a green outline. ""The triangle with the red outline"" is my choice. It is concise, accurate, and highlights the crucial differentiating feature. The fill pattern becomes redundant information for distinguishing the two triangles. This is the optimal strategy because, of the visible items, there is no other red-outlined triangle. It will allow the listener to identify the target efficiently and effectively.

exp2_079.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,circle,green,dot,"3,2",The circle that is filled with dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game and need to help someone identify a specific object in a grid. My task is to provide the most effective description of the target, the one in the middle right. I start by analyzing the image, noting the 3x3 grid layout and the objects: a blue-bordered square with grey dots, a black-bordered star with grey dots, a red-bordered star with grey dots, a blue-bordered circle with a wavy pattern, and *finally* the target – a green-bordered circle filled with grey dots.

My first thought is to zero in on the unique features of the target. Shape: It's a circle. Border: It's green and solid. Fill: Grey dots in a grid. The key is to isolate what *uniquely* identifies this object. ""The circle"" isn't enough; there's another. ""The object with dots"" is also out; a few have that. I compare the target to all the distractors, looking for distinct features. The green border is unique! But so is the combination of circle-shape and grey dot fill.

I've got two strong candidates forming: ""The green circle"" or ""The circle filled with grey dots."" The green color is very salient. The dot-fill makes it different from the wavy pattern. Let's weigh them. ""The green circle"" is concise, and there's only one green thing. ""The circle filled with dots"" is also unambiguous, and there's only one of that type. I'm leaning toward ""The green circle"" for simplicity. Let's make sure it's the simplest description. ""The green circle with grey dots inside"" - a bit long. ""The green circle"" or ""The object with the green border"". Both are good. ""The green circle"" seems best.

Rechecking for ambiguity is important. Is there *any* other green thing in the image? No. Another circle? Yes, but it has a wavy pattern. ""Green circle"" makes the difference. I check ""The circle filled with dots"" as well. It works since there's another circle, but the other has waves.

So, I consider this, ""The green circle"" vs. ""The circle filled with dots"". Both are good. The first focuses on the color and shape, while the second relies on shape and the inner fill pattern. The color is very salient.

Okay, let's create the final sentence. ""Select the circle with the green border"" is clean. ""Select the circle filled with dots"" is also good. Now, I want something more natural. ""It's the circle that has dots inside of it.""

Let me consider if my listener has different color perceptions, the fill pattern should be more robust. The other circle is filled with waves. Therefore, I can use a simpler description. ""The circle filled with dots."" is very clean. I check again. No other circle has dots. It clearly identifies the target. Alternatively, ""The green shape"" - concise, but is ""shape"" as clear as ""circle""? Okay, I'm back to ""The green circle"" and ""The circle filled with dots"". Both are unique and equally valid.

The final utterance to convey the target would then be, ""It's the circle that has dots inside of it.""
"
exp2_080.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,triangle,blue,dot,"2,3",It's the triangle with the blue outline that is filled with grey dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing an Object in a Reference Game**

Okay, here's how I'm approaching this: I need to describe the target object – the one in the red box – so someone else can identify it, especially given the distractors and the unknown hidden objects. I'm thinking like this:

1.  **First, break down the target:** It's a triangle. It has a blue outline. The inside is a pattern of grey dots in a triangular arrangement. And crucially, it's located in one of the cells of a 3x3 grid.

2.  **Next, I analyze the competition, the distractors:** There's a star with a thick black outline and a checkerboard pattern inside. There's a square, also with a blue outline, and also a checkerboard pattern. There are two covered cells, and I don't know what's behind them. There are four empty cells too.

3.  **Now, to build a description:** I'll start with the basics: ""It's a triangle."" Then, the outline: ""It has a blue outline.""  And the fill pattern: ""The inside is filled with grey dots.""

4.  **The critical step: differentiating it from the decoys:** The star is a completely different shape, so the shape description handles that. The checkerboard square is also of a different shape (a square). Also, its pattern is completely different, a checkerboard, whereas the object I'm describing has the dotted pattern. The blue outline is shared by the square, but the patterns will set them apart. The dot fill pattern is unique. The shape is unique too.

5.  **Dealing with the unknowns:** I have no idea what's behind those curtains, so I need to be careful. I have to make a description that's good enough to distinguish it. Even a clear description, like ""The triangle with a blue outline and a pattern of grey dots"", is very specific. It would be an improbable coincidence if the hidden object were the same.

6.  **Forming the final utterance:** Let's see... ""Select the triangle with a blue border"" is a start. But is it enough? Maybe the hidden object has a blue border too! ""Select the shape filled with grey dots"" is pretty good, as the others have checkerboards. I want a combined approach to be sure. ""It's the triangle with a blue outline and the grey dot fill pattern."" I can try to be more concise. ""The object is a triangle with a blue outline, and it's filled with grey dots."" That's good. Or ""It's the shape filled with dots."" That's simple and likely effective. So a combination of shape and fill seems best. Let's try ""It's the triangle filled with grey dots."" Adding the blue border is also good. ""It is a triangle with a blue outline and a pattern of grey dots inside.""

7.  **Final Checks:** Am I using spatial cues? Nope, I am not saying ""bottom middle"" or ""next to the star"". Descriptive enough? Yes, shape, border color, and fill pattern are covered. Concise? Yes, I'm aiming for clarity without unnecessary length.

The best description is, ""The object is a triangle with a blue outline, and it's filled with grey dots."" This is robust. I could also use ""It's the triangle filled with gray dots"" to keep it short. Since the shape (triangle) is unique among visible objects and the fill pattern (dots) is also unique, the shorter approach is better. Then let's add the border colour.

Ultimately, I will choose something like this: ""It's the triangle with a blue outline that's filled with grey dots."" This should be clear and robust.

exp2_081.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,triangle,green,checker,"2,1",The triangle with the checkerboard pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object clearly enough that someone else can pinpoint it. I can't rely on positional information; I need to find its unique visual signature.

First, I need to break down the target: It's a triangle, outlined in green, and has a grey and white checkerboard fill pattern. I have to analyze the distractors to determine the best description.

I'm noting the distractors: I see a couple of green circles, with stripe and polka dot fills, and a red circle with stripes, and *another* green triangle with a wavy fill. Okay, the presence of the second triangle changes things.

I'm ignoring the irrelevant rule about red curtains and question marks. This isn't relevant to my task.

I need to pick a description that stands out. Shape alone (""triangle"") is useless since there are two. Colour isn't enough, either, since both triangles are green. The fill pattern seems key here. The other triangle has wavy lines, but mine is checkerboard. This is the differentiating feature. Also, the shapes of the other objects are irrelevant.

So, I start formulating an utterance. ""There is a triangle with a checkerboard pattern inside."" That seems pretty unambiguous. I'm double-checking to make sure the other shapes don't have a checkerboard fill. Nope.

Let's brainstorm a few alternatives: ""The green triangle with the checkerboard fill"" is good since it combines multiple features. ""The object with the grey and white checkerboard pattern"" focuses on the unique pattern, which also works. I could be more detailed, but I think that's overkill.

So, I consider this: is ""the green"" necessary? Both triangles are green. But the other triangle has a wavy pattern, and it has no checkerboard fill. And the other shapes are also all unique. So, I realize that the checkerboard pattern is the defining feature. ""The triangle with the checkerboard pattern inside"" seems concise and accurate.

I'm thinking about the colors. The target is green with grey and white. The other is green with grey. It doesn't help to say that the checkerboard is grey and white.

So, I've refined it to ""The triangle with the checkerboard pattern,"" or ""The shape with the checkerboard pattern."" The first might be clearer, since there is only one shape. I'm also considering including ""inside,"" to reduce ambiguity.

My final choice is: ""The triangle with the checkerboard pattern inside."" This is a concise and accurate way to describe it. This should be clear and effective.

exp2_082.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,triangle,green,stripe,"2,1",Select the green triangle with vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with acting as the speaker in a reference game. My objective is clear: describe this target object so well that someone else, with a different view, can pinpoint it precisely.  Here's how my mind is working through this:

First, I need to *really* analyze the setup. It's a 3x3 grid, and I can see some of the squares are empty, while others have objects.  Crucially, some are hidden – they're behind a red curtain with a question mark.  My target is highlighted; I can see it, but the other person can't see the dashed red box.

Now, let's zoom in on the target. It's in the top row, middle column.  It's a green triangle.  And inside that triangle are vertical gray stripes.

Next, I have to identify the other visible objects. There's a black circle in the middle row, left column. It has the same vertical stripes as the target triangle, making this a common feature I need to be careful with.

I *don't* know what's hidden.  That's a huge factor! This means I can't rely on assumptions like, ""it's the only triangle.""  There might be another triangle lurking behind one of those red curtains! So, I need to be precise.

My initial thought, and it's a good starting point, is ""It's the green triangle.""  Simple, efficient.  The other visible object is a black circle, so the term ""triangle"" immediately distinguishes it by shape. The term ""green"" makes the distinction by color. I consider the stripes; both objects have them, so mentioning stripes doesn't *currently* help me distinguish among visible objects. However, they are a feature of the target that I might want to include, in case they are important, later.

Okay, let's explore this further.  What if there *is* another green triangle?  Or any triangle? Saying ""the green triangle"" would fail! So, would just saying ""the triangle"", or ""the green object"". So I need to evaluate the properties of the target based on its own features: It's a triangle; green outline; vertical gray stripes inside. The visible distractor: It's a circle; a black outline; vertical gray stripes inside. The main distinguishing features between the visible objects are shape and color, and both have vertical gray stripes.

A really strong description would be ""The green triangle."" Clear, concise. Now, what about ""the object with a green outline""? It's an alternative, but the other shape also has a color outline, so, while valid, it is less descriptive. The next one is ""the triangle with vertical stripes."" Good, but it relies on shape, and my goal is to be robust against unknowns!

So, the optimal description has to be the most robust and informative. I cannot know what's hidden; therefore, my description must uniquely identify the target *among all* objects on the user's grid.

Since the other, visible shape, has vertical stripes, I cannot assume that these are unique, and thus, I need to include multiple factors for my description. I need to make sure I am distinct from the visible, but also *possibly* any hidden objects.

So let me construct the minimal description that is still sufficient. ""The green triangle"" works. It uniquely identifies it from the visible object. Is there a reason *not* to say ""green triangle""? No. It's concise and accurate, and the most likely unique description. Adding ""with vertical stripes"" seems redundant, but it adds specificity, in case there is a solid green triangle hidden.

I can't assume a minimal description, like just ""green"", or ""triangle"", is sufficient. So I need to describe it by combining shape and color: the ""green triangle"".

Let me focus on the key difference in *properties* between the two visible objects. I can use the shape or color to do this. I also need to focus on what will make my description robust in case another similar object is hidden.

Shape: ""The triangle."" That assumes there are no other triangles.

Color: ""The green object."" That assumes there are no other green objects.

Combining these seems best: ""The green triangle.""

I will stick with this, as it is concise, and has a high likelihood of being unique. I think adding the stripes feels redundant, as they are a shared characteristic of the visible, but adding those stripes adds robustness against the hidden, so I will add them in.

Finally, I will say, ""Select the green triangle that has vertical stripes,"" as this is robust, even though ""Select the green triangle"" is the most concise.
"
exp2_083.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,star,red,dot,"3,3",It's the star with the red border that is filled with dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object within this 3x3 grid so that another person can select it accurately. First, I need to analyze the visual data provided. I see a 3x3 grid, and only four objects are visible. The objects are a square with a green border and grey vertical stripes, a triangle with a red border and grey vertical stripes, a circle with a blue border and a grey and white checkerboard, and finally, my target object, a five-pointed star with a red border and filled with grey dots. The rest of the cells are empty.

My immediate task is to identify the highlighted object which is the five-pointed star in the bottom right cell. Now comes the critical part: crafting a description. I have to create a description that uniquely identifies this star. The most direct identifier is that it's a star; there's only one in this immediate visual field. The fill pattern of the star, grey dots, is also unique; no other object shares that. The red border, while shared by the triangle, is another visual feature, but it's not the primary identifier.

Since the prompt indicates that I should not use any spatial locations, my description must be independent of its placement in the grid. I also must keep in mind, and take into consideration, that there may be other objects hidden from my view, as indicated by the prompt.

Now, let's formulate some possible descriptions, keeping in mind simplicity and precision: ""It's a star,"" or ""The object filled with dots."" These options are clear and effective. I could also include the border color: ""The star with a red border"" or ""The red-bordered object with dots inside.""

The rule that tells me to avoid degenerate spatial locations means that I should not rely on something like “the one in the bottom right corner.” The prompt also indicates that there might be hidden objects, which means my description needs to be as robust as possible. I should rely only on visible features.

Let's refine the description. ""The star with dots"" seems very effective. Checking for potential confusion, there’s nothing else that's a star in the image, so I don't need to specify anything further. ""The object with dots"" is also sufficient as nothing else has this fill pattern.

I will combine both features to be certain that I am clear and concise. The star does have a red border, but that is shared by the triangle, so it is not sufficient. Therefore, shape and fill are the key features.

My final choice, after iterating on the combination of shape and fill pattern is, ""Select the star that is filled with dots."" This is unambiguous and should allow the other player to correctly identify the target. I'll stick with that.
"
exp2_084.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,circle,black,wavy,"2,1",The object is a circle with a wavy pattern inside and a black border.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with playing a reference game. My goal is to describe a specific object so someone else can identify it from a visual array. A dashed red box clearly indicates the target. Let's break this down systematically.

First, I need to *analyze the target object itself.* It's a circle, which is the obvious starting point. It has a thick black border and the interior is filled with a distinctive wavy grey and white pattern.

Next, I have to *consider the distractors.* There's another circle, but this one has a green border, and shares the same wavy grey and white pattern. There's also a triangle with a blue border and a grey and white checkerboard pattern filling its inside. Finally, there are two objects hidden behind red curtains with white question marks. Since I can't see them, I have to consider the *possibility* of what they could be.

Now comes the crucial part: *formulating a description.* I need to be precise enough to differentiate the target from what I can see, while also keeping in mind those hidden possibilities. The border color is the most striking difference between the two circles. They both have the same wavy pattern, so, mentioning the black border of the target is crucial.

I started drafting some initial descriptions. ""The circle with the black border"" is concise. Then there's ""The circle with the wavy pattern and a black outline,"" this includes the pattern. A description like ""The object in the top row, middle column"" is out, as I was explicitly instructed not to use spatial references.

I need to *select the best description.* ""The circle with the black border"" seems the most efficient. The border color is the most obvious differentiator and since there's another circle, but with a green border, it is best. And, ""The circle filled with a wavy pattern that has a black outline."" is a safer bet, in case one of the hidden objects has a black border.

Considering everything, I think a robust description will combine a few ideas: ""It's a circle with a wavy pattern inside and a black border."" The black border is essential because it is the only difference between the two circles.

A shorter version might be good too: ""The circle with the black border."" This is direct. Given the options, this is the most direct and least ambiguous way to point it out from the other visible circle. The wavy pattern is shared, so the border color is the key differentiator between the two circles.

In summary, the key differentiating features are the shape (circle), the border (black), and the pattern (wavy).

Comparing the two circles:
- Target: Circle, Black Border, Wavy Pattern
- Distractor: Circle, Green Border, Wavy Pattern

So, my final and most efficient description is simply: ""The circle with the black border"". It's to the point and addresses the most critical distinction.

Okay, so I'm being tasked with acting as a speaker in a reference game. My main job here is to give a solid description of the target object so someone else can pick it out, without giving away its location. I need to be unambiguous and specific, especially because there are some hidden objects involved that the other player *can* see. Alright, let's break this down systematically.

First, I've got to analyze the visual scene. I see a 3x3 grid, but some cells are empty. The key here is to nail down the features of that target: a triangle with a thick green border, and inside, gray and white wavy horizontal stripes. Easy enough. I can also see a distractor: a star with a thick black border and gray/white vertical stripes.

Now, I need to think about how to best distinguish the target from the star, *and* make it robust against the unknown contents of those two hidden spaces. Shape, border color, and internal pattern – those are the key discriminators. The target's triangle shape and green border give me a good start. I also need to be certain my description is not accidentally pointing to one of the hidden objects.

I'm starting by identifying the most prominent features of each object, then I have to compare them. The obvious differences jump out: triangle vs. star, green vs. black border, wavy vs. straight/vertical stripes. Those are some pretty strong distinctions, I think.

I'm now drafting descriptions: ""The triangle,"" or ""The object with the green border"" are too simple. I have to combine these features. For example, ""The triangle with wavy lines inside."" That seems more promising. Then, I had the idea to make it even more specific: ""The green-bordered triangle with wavy horizontal stripes."" That's very detailed, though perhaps too long. So I want to be concise but unambiguous.

The shape and color feels right: ""The green triangle."" ""The triangle with a green border."" Simpler, and the other obvious distractor is a black star. I think I will use the wavy lines, since it's a more nuanced pattern: ""The triangle with wavy lines.""

Since the shape and the border are strong descriptors, combining those two should be sufficient: ""The triangle with the green outline"". That seems direct and clear. The odds of another triangle having a green outline are low. I might also try ""The triangle with wavy lines inside,"" since the star uses straight lines. 

Ultimately, I think the best description will be, ""Select the triangle with wavy lines inside."" It is robust, and direct. The shape of the triangle and the pattern of wavy lines are specific enough to make it unambiguous, especially relative to the star.

exp2_086.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,star,black,dot,"2,3",The star with a black outline that is filled with polka dots.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I need to act as the speaker in this reference game. My objective is to describe the designated target object in such a way that another person can pinpoint it accurately. The image is a 3x3 grid, with some cells populated and others empty. I need to focus on what's visible, and ignore the hidden cells.

First, I've broken down the image into its components. There's a star in the top-left with a green outline and a gray, wavy pattern inside. Then there's the hidden red curtains. The target is the star at the bottom-middle. It's the one highlighted with the red dashed box. It has a black outline and a gray polka dot pattern within.

Now I need to zero in on what makes the target unique. The most obvious features are its black outline and the polka-dot filling. The only other visible star is the one in the top-left; it's got a green outline and a wavy pattern. So I need to use those differences to be specific. The hidden objects are a wild card – I can't know what’s behind the curtains, so I need to formulate my description in a way that’s most robust to anything that could possibly be there.

My approach is to create a description that leverages those distinctive features. First, I focus on *color*: the target has a black outline. Then, *pattern*: The target has a polka dot pattern. I’ll combine these: “The star with a black outline and a polka dot pattern.” Combining color and pattern makes it highly unlikely that the hidden object will have the same attributes.

I’m refining the wording for clarity. Let's make sure it's unambiguous: ""The star with a black outline filled with polka dots."" Perfect! It doesn't use location (""bottom-middle"" is out), and doesn't explicitly refer to hidden objects. And it's robust because it leverages multiple unique features. I think that's the best I can do.

exp2_087.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,star,black,checker,"1,2",The star with a checkered pattern inside.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to describe the target object so that the listener, even with different perspectives, can identify it. I'll need to be precise and avoid any ambiguities.

First, I need to understand the visual field. I see a 3x3 grid with four objects present. I'll start by analyzing the objects: there's a green triangle with wavy insides, a star with vertical stripes, a star with a checkered pattern (that's the target!), and a red square filled with dots. The key, of course, is that the listener could be seeing the objects from a different angle or arrangement, so absolute spatial references like ""left"" or ""middle"" are completely off-limits. I'm assuming the listener can see the same objects that I see.

Then, I'm focusing on the target, which is that checkered star. It's a star, definitely. And it has a bold black outline. The fill is where the magic lies – a grey and white checkered, or checkerboard, pattern, which is the crucial differentiator here.

Next, I need to carefully differentiate that target from other objects. One other star has an outline and is filled with vertical black and white stripes. I'll need to articulate the important differences. The triangle has wavy insides, and the square has a grid of dots.

The goal is to formulate a description that is accurate, unambiguous, concise, and spatial-reference-free. I can't be wishy-washy here! We have two stars. They both have a black outline. The defining feature is the internal pattern: The target has a checkered pattern inside while the other star has vertical stripes.

My plan is to choose a concise description. ""The star with the checkered pattern inside"" seems direct, accurate, and unambiguous. ""The star with a grey and white checkerboard fill"" would also work. Checkered is far more accurate than saying ""squares"".

In the end, I need to ensure that the description is accurate, unambiguous, avoids spatial language, and is concise. I'm confident that ""The star with the checkered pattern inside"" nails it.
"
exp2_088.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,circle,red,checker,"3,2",The circle with the checkerboard pattern.,"Okay, here's the breakdown of my thought process for describing this target object. The user wants me to be a reference game speaker, so my job is to guide someone to select the correct object.

First, I see the object—a circle with a red outline and a grey and white checkerboard pattern filling it. I take inventory of the other objects to understand what features are unique. There's a star (blue dots), a triangle (grey/white checkerboard), another star (red checkerboard), and a square (wavy lines).

I need to find the distinctive aspects of the target. Shape first: it's a circle, which stands out immediately because nothing else visible shares that shape. The color is red for the outline, but another object is also red, so that's not uniquely distinguishing. The pattern is checkerboard, but that's shared with two other objects.

To be precise, I can combine features. ""The red circle"" sounds good, especially since there are no other circles, and it uses one of the unique features (the shape). ""The circle with the checkerboard pattern"" also distinguishes it because only the target object is a circle. Using all three features is also a good option, but that seems excessive for the purpose here.

I must avoid relying on spatial descriptions, as the user's view might be different from mine. The real kicker is the possibility of hidden objects! This means I need to be *extra* cautious. My goal is to make my description as robust as possible to avoid ambiguous selection.

So, while ""the circle"" on its own *might* work, it's risky because there could be a hidden circle. “The checkerboard circle"" is slightly better and will be my answer. ""The red circle"" would also be a good choice. Ultimately, I settled on a description that uses a uniquely defining feature of ""the circle with the checkerboard pattern,"" as this description is descriptive and precise, and it includes a unique feature of the object.
"
exp2_089.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,4,square,black,dot,"3,3",It's the square with a grid of grey dots inside.,"**My Thought Process on Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game, and I need to describe a specific object so the user can select it. I'm focusing on features that uniquely identify this target object, considering the context of the displayed 3x3 grid, including objects I can see and those hidden behind curtains, which the user can see.

The target object is highlighted with a dashed red box, and it's a square. Inside the square is a grid of grey dots on a white background, framed by a solid black border. There are also two other objects I can see: a blue star with a checkerboard pattern and a red star with vertical stripes. I'm aware the user can also see objects behind the curtains.

The initial thought is to describe the object as ""A square with a grid of grey dots inside."" Then I consider the possibility of hidden objects. What if there's another square with dots? To make sure, I refine it to ""The object is a white square with a solid black border. Inside the border, there is a grid of evenly spaced grey dots."" I even consider ""There are 7 rows and 7 columns of dots"" to make the description precise.

I then break down the features: shape (square), border (black, solid), content (a pattern of dots), dot color (grey), dot arrangement (grid), and background color (white). The two visible stars have different features. So I think a simpler description is enough.

I explore possibilities like ""the square filled with grey dots"" or even ""the object with a pattern of grey dots"" which are shorter but still accurate. It seems the ""square"" is a key distinction because the other objects are stars. ""Select the square that has a grid of grey dots inside"" seems accurate and robust.

I then think about the user’s view and what might be behind the curtains. Could there be a ""square with a grid of blue dots"" or a ""square with randomly placed grey dots"" or a ""circle with a grid of grey dots""? The description, ""the square with a grid of grey dots"" addresses all of these.

Considering all options and possibilities, I decide to be concise but unambiguous. The object has three key features: a square shape, a black border, and a grid of grey dots. I test out phrasing like ""It's a square with a black border containing a grid of grey dots,"" but this feels a bit verbose.

I eventually settle on ""The square with a grid of grey dots,"" since the shape and pattern are the most salient and easily differentiated. Since the other objects visible are stars with different patterns, “square” combined with “grid of grey dots” should be enough to specify the correct object, and is robust enough to deal with anything behind the curtains.
"
exp2_090.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,triangle,green,dot,"3,2","The object is a triangle with a green border, filled with gray dots.","**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game, and my goal is to describe an object in a grid so the listener can identify it. First, I need to analyze the visual information. I see a 3x3 grid with various cells, some empty, some containing objects. The target is a triangle in the middle row, rightmost column, highlighted by a red box.

My initial description is that it's a triangle with a green outline and filled with grey dots. I'll note the other visible objects: a red curtain with a question mark, a green circle filled with grey stripes, and another curtain/question mark. Importantly, I don't know what's *behind* the curtains, but the listener does. That's a key piece of information that influences my strategy.

I need to come up with a description that's both accurate and unambiguous, even considering those unknown elements. The visible objects offer some clues. The green circle with stripes is the most immediate point of comparison. Shape (triangle vs. circle) and fill pattern (dots vs. stripes) are the most obvious differentiators. The green outline is a shared feature, so it’s less useful for immediate distinction but still potentially helpful overall.

I'm thinking, could there be another triangle hidden? Or another object with a green outline or grey dots? I need to be specific. I'll try several drafts. ""It's the triangle"" is too simple. ""It's the green triangle"" is better, but not enough. ""It's the triangle filled with dots"" is getting closer. ""It's the green triangle filled with grey dots"" is the most complete so far.

Considering the game's context – concise but accurate communication – I'm weighing the features. The shape (triangle) and the fill (dots) are the most salient and provide the most immediate distinction. I could describe the other object to highlight the distinctions. Let's try to be conversational, like ""Select the green triangle that's filled with dots."" I could shorten that further. But what if there is another triangle?

I'm checking for redundancy. Is 'green' essential? It distinguishes it from the circle, and maybe hidden objects. Are 'dots' and 'triangle' necessary? Definitely. They are the primary and secondary shape identifiers. 

Ultimately, the best description needs to be as unique as possible while being understandable to the listener.

So I arrive at this description ""The green triangle filled with gray dots"". This description offers three key features: color, shape and fill. I believe this should be sufficient to identify the object and to prevent ambiguity with hidden objects.
"
exp2_091.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,3,square,black,wavy,"2,1",Select the square that has a wavy pattern inside.,"**My Analysis for Identifying the Target Object**

Okay, here's the task: I need to describe a target object clearly so someone else can identify it. I need to make sure my descriptions are the most efficient and least ambiguous. First, I need to understand the visual information. The target object is a square with a thick black border, and a wavy grey and white pattern inside. It's in the top-middle cell of a 3x3 grid. I see three other objects as distractors: a blue triangle with a checkerboard pattern (top-right), a green triangle with the same checkerboard pattern (middle-right), and a green circle with the same wavy pattern as the target (bottom-middle). I can't refer to the red dashed box around the target, because the listener won't see that. I see all the objects, but the listener might not. Some of the objects could be hidden from their view.

I'm focusing on features that make the target unique. The square shape is a standout since there are no other squares. The black border is also unique, as the other objects have blue and green borders. The wavy pattern is *not* unique, because the green circle also has this pattern. But, the combination of shape and pattern is.

Given that the listener's view might differ, I can't use positional references. So, how can I be precise, efficient and safe? I can describe the object as ""the square"" since that’s unique. Or, ""the object with a black border"". Although I could make it more robust, by combining features such as ""It's the square with the black border and a wavy pattern inside."". I also need to think about potential ambiguities. The key is to describe the target relative to the other objects that are visible to *both* me and the listener.

If I consider the information I know, I can see that the shapes and the patterns are the distinguishing features: I can describe it as ""select the square that has a wavy pattern inside"". ""The object is a square with a black outline and a grey and white wavy pattern inside"" could also be given, but it is maybe too detailed. So what's the most effective description? ""The shape is a square with a wavy pattern inside"", or ""It's the square-shaped object with wavy lines."" or ""The target is the square. It has a wavy pattern inside, not a checkerboard pattern."" I could just simply say ""It's the square."" This works as long as the listener sees only one square. ""It's the object with a black border."" is also simple and unambiguous.

Considering the fact that a hidden object could share features, I have to err on the side of using more information. So I’ll combine both: ""It's the square with the black border."" Or I can also describe the shape and pattern, so ""It's the square with the wavy pattern."" The pattern offers a contrast to the shapes of the other objects (triangles). To be robust, I'm leaning towards, ""It's the square with the wavy pattern."" This uses the two most reliable visual clues.
"
exp2_092.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,triangle,red,dot,"1,3",The dotted triangle.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the task is clear. I need to describe this object so someone else can pick it out from the grid. It's the one highlighted in red. First, I'm analyzing the image; it's a 3x3 grid with several shapes. My target is the bottom-left one: a red-outlined triangle with a grey dotted pattern inside. The challenge is to be precise but concise, especially because spatial clues are off-limits, and there aren't any red curtains here, so that's one less thing to worry about.

I'm systematically identifying the features: the triangle's shape, the red outline, and the grey dotted pattern within. Now, I have to consider the other objects to differentiate. The grid contains a black-outlined, checkered triangle; a red-outlined, grey-dotted star; and a green-outlined, grey-dotted square.

To formulate the description, I'm thinking about which features are most discriminating. Saying ""the triangle"" alone is useless since there are two. So, I have to consider all the objects. ""Red-outlined triangle"" seems promising at first, as it distinguishes the target from the black-outlined triangle. But, then I think to myself:  ""The red-outlined object"" is ambiguous as it can also be the star. The ""dotted object"" is also ambiguous, as the star and the square have a dotted pattern.

I combine features. ""The red triangle"" could work, but it doesn't specify the pattern, even if the other triangle has a black outline. ""The triangle with dots"" is better because it contrasts with the checkered one. ""The red-outlined triangle"" works too. Then ""the red triangle with dots"" is the most complete, I think.

I start to get specific: ""The red triangle,"" which might work. But what if the listener thinks the entire triangle is red? ""The triangle with the red outline"" is more precise.  ""The dotted triangle"" works also. I can also try combining them: ""The dotted triangle with the red outline."" But this seems a little long. I then simplify ""The red, dotted triangle"" – is it red? Yes. Dotted? Yes. A triangle? Yes.

I start running it against the competitors: The black, checkered triangle; The red, dotted star, and the green, dotted square. The description ""Red, dotted triangle"" uniquely identifies my target.

I will use a combination of the shape and one other distinctive feature, either the outline color or the pattern. From the other triangle I can either distinguish by color (red vs black outline) or by pattern (dotted vs checkered). From the other red object, the star, I can distinguish by shape (triangle vs star). I can distinguish from the other dotted objects, the square and the star, by shape (triangle vs square and star) or by color (red vs green outline).

""The dotted triangle"" seems very effective. I look for the most salient difference. The pattern seems more visually distinct than the outline. Let's stick with that. Let me make sure: the listener sees the two triangles, one with a checkered pattern and one with a dotted pattern. They are going to select the triangle that has the dots. It's unambiguous!

The description I'll use is: **""The dotted triangle.""** It's concise, accurate, and highlights the most visually distinct feature.
"
exp2_093.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,square,red,wavy,"3,2",It's the square with the grey and white wavy pattern and a red border.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object within this 3x3 grid so that another person can identify it correctly. I can see there are four visible objects, plus some empty cells or hidden ones, so I need to be precise.

First, let's break down what I see. There's a red curtain with a question mark, a square with a dotted pattern, and another red curtain. The target, though, is that patterned square in the middle, right column. It's got a wavy pattern in grey and white, a solid red border, and a dashed red outline that only I can see. I will ignore the red box because the target audience cannot see this.

I'm focusing on features that differentiate the target. The wavy pattern is its key. The other pattern is a dotted pattern, which is easily distinguishable. The red border is another good clue, as the dotted object has a black border. I can't just say ""the one on the right"" or ""in the middle"" because that isn't specific enough. I need to rely on the *visual* features.

I need to make sure the description doesn't allow for ambiguity, even if something is hidden. The prompt says the other person *knows* what's behind the curtains. This means I have to assume any hidden object could have similar features to the visible ones. So, I have to be careful with my words, ensuring I'm being precise. I could make it very specific: ""the square with the grey and white wavy pattern inside a red border."" But, if a hidden object also has a wavy pattern but a different border color, I could be misleading.

My strategy is to be as specific as possible about the visible object, assuming it's unique among what is visible. The best way to differentiate them is by describing its features.
So, I considered multiple combinations: a *wavy pattern* with a *red border*. The dotted object has a *dotted pattern* and a *black border*. The curtains are simply curtains.

I need to make sure the description is concise but also complete. The wavy pattern is the most prominent feature and its difference to the dotted pattern is a solid difference. The border color is another strong differentiator. I'll combine them to make sure there's no misunderstanding.

So, I will go with ""The square with the wavy pattern and the red border."" This is simple and covers the two key features.

Now, checking the details. The description has to separate:
*   The dotted pattern and the black border, so that's good.
*   The red curtain with a question mark from the wavy pattern and the red border.

If there's something hidden behind the curtains, there's always a small chance that it has a wavy pattern and a red border, too. But that is the limit of my available knowledge. The listener is informed about the other objects. So, it should be simple to distinguish, or at least have enough information to make an educated guess. I have described multiple unique features.

Therefore, the final description: ""The square with the wavy pattern and the red border.""
"
exp2_094.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,star,green,dot,"1,3",Select the star with dots inside.,"**My Thought Process: Navigating the Reference Game**

Okay, so I'm playing this reference game. The goal is to get someone to select a specific object from a visual grid, and I need to do this using only a description. I'm given an image – a 3x3 grid with five objects in it – and I need to identify and describe the target object. It's marked by a red dashed box, a green star with grey dots.

First, I quickly analyzed the layout: a grid, objects with various shapes, colors, and internal patterns. I then zeroed in on the target, noting it’s a green, dotted star in the bottom-left corner. Now it's time to consider the distractions: a green circle with stripes, a black triangle with stripes, a red star with stripes, and a red circle with dots.

My strategy needs to be efficient. I can't just say “the green object” because there’s also a green circle. ""The star"" is no good either since there's another star that is red. ""The object with dots"" is also not suitable since there's a red circle with dots. I have to combine features.

I considered a few options. ""The green star"" is direct, and effectively uses the two distinguishing features of color and shape. Similarly, ""the star with dots"" uses shape and pattern. ""The green object with dots"" also works, although the ""object"" feel ambiguous.

I'm aiming for the most concise, yet unambiguous description. ""The green star"" is a solid contender. It quickly narrows down the field. The other star is red, the other green thing is a circle. ""The star with dots"" also works, efficiently utilizing shape and pattern to isolate the target. I ran through the distractors again, mentally comparing each description to the available items. The main challenge is finding the minimal description that is not ambiguous.

My final choice? ""The star with dots."" This is both clear and a bit more descriptive. This clearly leverages shape and pattern and should be sufficient.
"
exp2_095.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,circle,blue,dot,"1,3",The object filled with a polka dot pattern.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My task is to describe this object so someone else can pick it out of a set. I'm seeing an image with a 3x3 grid, and three objects are visible: a square, a triangle, and a circle. The target is indicated by a dashed red box – which, remember, I *cannot* mention. My priority is to find a description that uniquely identifies the target, which is the circle with the blue border and grey polka dots.

I need to analyze this: the square has a green border and a checkerboard pattern; the triangle is blue-bordered with a checkerboard pattern; and the circle, my target, has a blue border and the polka dot pattern. 

Clearly, ""the circle"" is a good starting point. It's the only one of those shapes, so that’s simple and effective. The polka dot pattern is another excellent distinguisher, as the other objects use the checkerboard. The blue border isn't unique, because the triangle also has a blue border, so this property alone isn’t sufficient. I also consider the possibility of hidden objects, but the visual input here doesn't present any red curtains, so I need not take that as a serious constraint. 

I’m weighing the options. ""The circle with polka dots"" or ""the object with polka dots"" both feel concise and precise. ""The blue circle"" would work, but the blue border is shared with the triangle. I'm also considering the possibility of more natural-sounding sentences such as ""You're looking for the circle with the dots inside.""

The visual features suggest emphasizing the polka dot pattern. The two distractors share a checkerboard pattern, so highlighting the target's distinctive pattern should be most salient.

Considering the simplicity and the need to provide a clear description in this context, I'm choosing a concise, direct, and unambiguous instruction.

Therefore, the final description is: ""The object with the polka dot pattern."" This is short, easy to understand, and focuses on the unique characteristic of the target object. ""The circle"" would also be a good choice.
"
exp2_096.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,star,green,dot,"1,3",It's a star with a green outline and grey dots inside.,"**My Thought Process: Selecting the Best Description**

Okay, so I need to describe a target object (highlighted with a red box) so that someone else can pick it out from a set of distractors. This sounds like a reference game, which is interesting. My mind immediately begins to break down the task.

First, I analyze the target. It's a star, the outline is green, and it's filled with grey dots. Now, I look at the other visible objects. There's a blue star (same shape, dot pattern), a wavy circle (circle shape), and a wavy triangle (triangle shape) – all with different colors and patterns from the target. The kicker? There are also *hidden* objects. That means I can't just rely on what's visible; my description needs to be precise enough to uniquely identify the target even if the hidden objects are similar in shape or pattern. I need to take the hidden objects into account even though I can't *see* them.

I start formulating my description. Since there are two stars, ""a star"" alone isn't enough. The distinguishing feature between the stars is the outline color. ""A star with a green outline"" would work. But, does the fill factor into uniqueness? Both stars have the same dotted fill pattern. ""A star with a green outline and grey dots inside"" is more descriptive.

I then start running through some alternative descriptions. Thinking about shape, I notice a pattern: the stars have dots, and the other shapes have a wavy pattern. So, I could say ""the object with a polka dot pattern and a green outline."" Okay, that's another option, focusing on color and shape is usually a strong strategy.

I then start refining. ""The green star"" is short. ""The star with the green outline"" is more formal. ""The star with the green outline and grey dots inside"" is the most detailed. Given the unknowns, more detail might be better, but simple is often preferred in these games.

I start to analyze which of the options is best: ""The green star"" is good. ""The star with the green outline"" is also good. Now, I compare the target to other objects. Both stars share the dotted fill. The circle and triangle have the same wavy fill. The key difference is the outline color.

I start trying to combine features: ""The object that is a star and has a green outline"" This works, so does ""The star filled with dots that has a green outline."" and ""The green star with grey dots inside.""

Ultimately, the most salient features that make it unique are the green outline and the pattern. The key difference between the stars is the outline. The simplest instruction? ""It's the star with the green outline."" I evaluate that again. Is that enough? Yes, that's enough. If the hidden objects were a green star with a different fill, this wouldn't work. The hidden objects are potentially similar, so I must take that into account, even though I cannot see them.

I keep thinking. I re-evaluate to be sure, and run through the potential distractors. My description has to be robust. It's not too long. I can try to make it more natural, more conversational.

I end up thinking ""The green star with the grey dots inside"" is the best. It's concise and covers all bases. Then I run through options. I could mention that both stars have dots, as a conversational lead, but stick with the simple properties of the target object. It needs to be clear and complete. So I think ""A star with a green outline, filled with grey dots."" This is good. It covers all bases.

exp2_097.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,3,square,black,stripe,"3,2",The square with vertical stripes.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I need to describe an object in a 3x3 grid, a reference game. My primary goal is to provide enough information that the listener, another player in the game, can identify the specific target object and differentiate it from any distractors, visible or hidden.

First, I assessed the visual data: I see a 3x3 grid, some empty cells, some cells with question marks (hidden objects), and others with visible objects. I noted the visible items: a striped star with a red outline, a striped square with a black border (that's the target!), and a dotted star with a blue outline. The left column is empty.

My immediate focus turned to the target: a square, with a thick black border, filled with vertical grey and white stripes. I need to make sure I don't give the listener too much information, but enough information.

Next, I analyzed the distractors. The red-outlined star shares the vertical stripe pattern, so ""the striped object"" is useless. The blue-outlined star is completely different. Hidden objects... I have no idea, but the game is supposed to be solvable. I need a robust description.

My initial thought was to use the most salient features: the shape (square) and the pattern (vertical stripes). I immediately recognized that just saying ""the one with vertical stripes"" is problematic because the red star also has those stripes. ""The square"" alone *should* work based on the current visible objects, but there *could* be another square hidden. If the hidden square has vertical stripes, the description would still be unique.

I began to consider how to construct my description, and how to test it. I started with ""It's a square filled with vertical grey and white stripes."" This is a good starting point. I could even say ""It's a square with a black border, filled with vertical stripes."" The black border is a distinguishing feature, but I can also use it to distinguish from a star with the same pattern, and I can be concise.

Comparing the distractors again helps. The red star shares the pattern, the blue star does not. The key difference is the shape! I need to ensure my description distinguishes from the red star and is robust against the unseen objects. Starting with shape is a good strategy: ""Select the square."" Is there only one? Yes, *visibly*. Is there a hidden one? Probably. Can the listener *see* it? Yes.

If there's another square, I'll need to specify the pattern: ""The square with vertical stripes."" If there is another *striped* square, the game is unsolvable. I am going to assume the game is well-designed. Combining shape and pattern is safest and most complete. The description should be short and precise.

I refined the wording: ""The square with vertical stripes."" That's good. Conciseness is key. ""There's a star with vertical stripes, and a square with vertical stripes. I want the square."" That's a relative description, but it works, but direct is better.

I considered the object's features and their uniqueness: the shape (square), the border (black), and the fill (vertical stripes). The fill is shared with the red star, but the shape is unique amongst *visible* objects. The border color is also unique. So: ""The square"" (ambiguous if there's a hidden one), ""The object with the black border"" (again potentially ambiguous), and finally: ""The square with vertical stripes."" The last one, if there's *another* square with stripes, the game is impossible. I will assume it's solvable.

The final description is ""The square with the vertical stripes."" It has to be accurate, clear, and concise.

I performed a final check. Does it differentiate from the red star? Yes, by shape. Does it differentiate from the blue star? Yes, both by shape and pattern. Is it robust against hidden objects? Yes, it *should* be. The combination of characteristics makes it quite unique. The description provides the shape and the filling pattern. It should be good to go.

exp2_098.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,square,blue,stripe,"1,2",It's the square with vertical stripes.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the object within the red box in such a way that another person can identify it from a set of distractors. I need to be precise and unambiguous.

First, I've got to analyze the target object thoroughly. I see a square shape with a blue border, and inside it's filled with a pattern of vertical grey and white stripes. I'm noting the shape, color, and internal pattern – these are my primary features.

Next, I'll examine the distractors. There's a star with a black border and a wavy pattern inside, and another star with a blue border and a checkered pattern. The key here is identifying *what* distinguishes the target from these distractors.

Based on the images, I'm thinking the most obvious differentiator is shape. The target is a square, and the distractors are stars. That's a strong starting point. The internal pattern (vertical stripes vs. wavy lines vs. checkered) also seems distinctive, so I'll also use that. The blue border isn't ideal because one of the stars has the same border.

Now, I'm formulating my description. I need to keep the ""no degenerate spatial locations"" rule in mind, which means I can't rely on relative positions like ""the one on the left"". I have to focus on the object's intrinsic qualities. ""The square"" is a concise and effective starting point, but I'll make it even more explicit. Combining shape and pattern gives me ""the square with vertical stripes"". Adding the color would also be useful, such as ""the square with a blue border and vertical stripes inside"", however the other blue border might confuse things, so I will stick to ""The square with vertical stripes"".

So, I've gone over the available descriptions, and I've decided my final and most robust choice will be: ""The square with vertical stripes."" This directly contrasts the square with the two stars based on a distinct pattern, and I'm confident that should be enough to allow the other person to easily identify the correct object.

exp2_099.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,circle,green,wavy,"2,3",It's the green circle.,"**My Thought Process for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My objective is to describe the target object clearly enough that someone else can pick it out. Let's break this down systematically.

First, I see a 3x3 grid with four visible objects. I have to analyze these objects. I've got to make sure my description is precise.

I identify the target – a green circle with a grey wavy pattern, highlighted by a red dashed box. Now, I have to think about what makes this object *unique* from the others. I can't just say ""the circle"" because there's another one. And I can't just say ""the green object"" because there's also a green square. ""The object with the grey wavy pattern"" is also ambiguous, as the green square has the same pattern.

I consider all the distractors: a green square with a grey wavy pattern, a blue circle with grey vertical stripes, and a red star with grey vertical stripes. Now, I consider the attributes of each object: shape, color, fill pattern.

I'm thinking, ""Okay, the target is a circle. What's different?"" The other circle is blue, so “the green circle” is enough. ""The green circle"" alone makes it distinct. So, I will focus on the fact that I have a circle that is green. So ""the green circle"". ""The circle with the wavy pattern"" is also a good option, as the only other circle has vertical stripes.

Then, there are the constraints. No spatial descriptions – I can't say ""the one in the bottom middle."" And I'm warned about hidden objects, which reinforces the need to be really specific. The listener's arrangement might differ too, so any spatial hints will be useless.

So, I consider: Is “the green circle” enough? Yep, the other circle is blue. How about ""the circle with the wavy pattern""? Also, good. I will choose from these descriptions.

I weigh the options. “The green circle” is concise, simple, and direct. The other objects' attributes (the green square and the blue circle) makes this an excellent description. “The circle with the wavy pattern” also works.

So, given these options, I will go with ""the green circle."" That's the most straightforward and effective.
"
exp2_100.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,square,green,dot,"3,2","The object is a square with a solid green border, filled with a grid of grey dots.","**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to describe the highlighted target object so effectively that someone else can pinpoint it. I need to be precise and unambiguous.

First, I need to understand the scene. It's a 3x3 grid with varying content: empty cells, visible objects, and hidden objects behind red curtains. The target, indicated by the dashed red box, is what I need to focus on.

I start by systematically identifying all the objects I *can* see. In the top-left, I see a square with a grey and white checkerboard pattern, outlined in solid green. Then there are some red curtains with white question marks, and empty white squares. The target object, which is my focus, is in the middle-right position. It's also a square, has a solid green border, and inside the border is a grid of grey dots on a white background.

Now the real challenge begins: I need to formulate a description that's not only accurate but also robust. I *cannot* rely on spatial location because the listener might have a different arrangement of objects. My description needs to be reliable, even if there are identical objects hidden behind those curtains.

So, I need to focus on the distinguishing characteristics of the target object. I need to contrast it with any other visible object, particularly that checkerboard. Both share the green outline. The critical difference is the internal pattern: the target has grey dots, while the other object has a checkerboard.

Now I'm drafting the description. I'm starting with a point of reference: ""There are two visible objects with a green border."" That narrows down the field. Then I specify the target: ""The target is the one with grey dots inside the border."" That's the most straightforward way to distinguish it. I might also add, ""It's not the one with the checkerboard pattern,"" to ensure there's no confusion.

I start to refine it. I think ""The object with a green border and filled with grey dots"" is pretty concise and accurate. It clearly separates the target from the checkerboard. And it doesn't depend on location; the features are intrinsic to the object itself.

Before I give a final answer, I do a final check. Does this description *uniquely* identify the target, given the possibility of hidden objects? I have to be pragmatic. I can't know what's behind the curtains. But this description focuses on the visible, unique features. ""A green-bordered square filled with grey dots"" is very specific. While there is no guarantee, it's unlikely that something identical is hidden. Even if it is, the listener can always ask for clarification. The green border and the grey dot pattern are the most salient features.

I consider another approach: ""It's a square with a solid green outline."" (True of the checkerboard, so that's not it.) Then I'll add ""…and inside the outline, there's a grid of grey dots."" (That makes it unique.)

I feel confident in this description. I'll use it.
"
exp2_101.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,circle,green,checker,"3,3",The object is a circle with a green border and a checkerboard pattern inside.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the descriptor in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to guide the other person to identify the target object. It's highlighted with a red dashed box, so I'm assuming that's the one I need to focus on.

First, let's break down the image. It's a 3x3 grid. I see that some cells are empty, but the important stuff lies within the grid's filled cells. There are two ""mystery"" objects hidden behind red curtains; I have no idea what they are, but the listener does. Then, there are two visible, non-hidden objects: these are green-bordered circles with internal patterns. The target is *one* of these circles.

Now, here's the crucial step: identifying the target. It's the one inside the dashed box. I can clearly see it's a circle, framed by a green border. Inside, the visual information is a grid-like checkerboard pattern composed of grey and white squares.

Next, I need to understand what I'm up against in terms of *distractors*. The other visible object, a green-bordered circle containing a pattern of grey and white vertical stripes, is my immediate concern. I need to make sure I *don't* confuse the listener with that. Of course, the two hidden objects present an *unknown* variable.

The key is in the description. I *can't* rely on spatial cues like ""bottom right,"" because the grid configuration might be different for the listener. I need a descriptor that's both *unique* and *clear*. The pattern inside the target circle is the main differentiator, the 'hook' for the description.

So, I start to draft a description, keeping the pattern distinct from the striped circle in mind. ""The object is a circle with a green border and a checkerboard pattern inside,"" seems good. Or, ""Select the green circle with the checkerboard pattern."" This focuses on the patterns, I think.

I will consider refining my descriptions as follows:

*   **Shape:** Circle.
*   **Border:** Green.
*   **Pattern:** Checkerboard, checkered, or made of squares, I think 'checkerboard' is concise here.

Combining these, ""The object is a green-bordered circle with a checkerboard pattern inside."" That should be robust. It distinguishes it, even if the hidden objects are also circles. I need to make sure I include the ""checkerboard pattern,"" because this is the critical differentiator.

I'm checking my work: Does the description use spatial locations? Nope. Is it specific to the target? Definitely, especially in relation to the striped circle. Is it clear and concise? Yes, I think so.

So, here's my final decision: ""It's the green-bordered circle with a checkerboard pattern inside."" Alternatively, I could say ""The circle with the green outline has a checkerboard pattern inside."" Or, ""The object is a circle with a green border, filled with a grey and white checkerboard pattern."" I am going to stick with the most direct: ""It's the green-bordered circle with a checkerboard pattern inside."" This gets straight to the point.
"
exp2_102.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,square,black,checker,"3,1",The square with the checkerboard pattern.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, the goal is to describe a specific object in a 3x3 grid so that someone else can identify it. I need to be precise, but also efficient. I'm imagining this is a reference game.

First, let's break down the target: it's in the top right, it's a square, it has a black border, and it's filled with a gray and white checkerboard pattern.

Next, I look at the distractors: top-left is a blue triangle checkerboard, top-middle a red triangle wavy lines, middle-left is a blue circle with wavy lines, and bottom-right a green triangle checkerboard. The other cells are empty.

Now, I consider the key features for description. The shape is the strongest feature here – it's the only square. The pattern (checkerboard) is shared by two other objects, so it's not enough on its own. The black border is unique, and, combined with the checkerboard, becomes even stronger.

My initial thought is that the shape should be the primary descriptor since it's unique. However, I want to confirm that there are no ambiguous cases.

So, I evaluate the description options:

*   ""The square"" - This seems sufficient because there's only one.
*   ""The object with the black border"" - Also works.
*   ""The square with a checkerboard pattern"" - Very accurate, and it combines features.
*   ""The object in the top right"" - The prompt forbids spatial locations.

I want to focus on visual properties and avoid spatial references as that is forbidden, and shape is the most direct.

To be concise and accurate, ""the square"" is good, but adding the pattern might be more robust.

I check for any possible ambiguity with different possible descriptions. There are no other squares. There are no other objects with a black border. There are other objects with a checkerboard pattern, so ""checkerboard"" is not enough, but is a good secondary description. I keep thinking about the context of the game. I could describe the border, but I don't think it is necessary because of the lack of other squares, and might be unnecessary.

I want to decide on a single description, and I am thinking that I should combine shape with a differentiating visual pattern. The shape is the distinguishing feature, but I could add in the pattern as a reinforcing feature. So, ""The square with a checkerboard pattern."" is my first choice.

I go back to consider the distractors again. The checkerboard pattern is found in the blue triangle and the green triangle. The wavy pattern is found in the red triangle and the blue circle. The only unique feature is the square. I could use ""The square,"" but I can add the pattern.

I try to formulate a few options:

*   ""It's the only square.""
*   ""The object with a square shape.""
*   ""The square that has a black border and a checkerboard pattern inside.""

I think that being concise and accurate is best. I'll go with ""The square with a checkerboard pattern.""

I imagine potential misunderstandings. Could someone mistake a triangle for a square? No. A circle? No. So, it is a solid description. I think about the ""red curtain"" context. I cannot rely on a process of elimination, but have to describe the target on its own properties. These are: the square shape, the black border, and the checkerboard pattern. These, combined, are unique. Even the shape alone is unique.

I settle on the shape. ""The square with a checkerboard pattern."" This is simple, accurate, and unambiguous. It's the most concise way to specify the target.
"
exp2_103.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,square,red,dot,"2,1",It's the square filled with gray dots.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, here's how I'm approaching this reference game. The user wants me to identify an object within a 3x3 grid. My core goal is clarity, avoiding ambiguity so the other person can *uniquely* identify the target.

First, I've broken down the image. I see a 3x3 grid. The top-left and bottom-middle cells are red curtains with question marks – these are ""hidden"" and I need to assume I *can't* see what's behind them. The target, the focus of the description, is in the top-middle cell: a square with a red dashed border, filled with a grid of grey dots. In the top-right is a circle also filled with grey dots. The rest of the cells are empty.

Now, to identify the target, I'm analyzing it's properties. It's a square, it contains grey dots.

I've got a square and a circle, both with grey dots. This circle is my key distractor. I need to formulate a description that clearly distinguishes the target from that circle, and, as much as possible, the ""hidden"" objects too. Since I'm essentially blind to them, I have to make an assumption of ""unlikely to be the same"" as the target (or, if it is, that my description still holds)

I'm thinking about the most salient differentiating feature. They both have grey dots, but their *shape* is different. That's the key. I can use this to my advantage.

I considered a few options: ""It's the square with grey dots,"" ""It's the shape with grey dots that is a square,"" or ""It's the square filled with a grid of grey dots."" The final one is the most precise and accurate. It uses simple language.

I checked for the potential for ambiguity - spatial location is avoided, as I'm thinking of a *description* and not a *direction*. The shape is key - it distinguishes from the circle and will hopefully be true of the ""hidden"" objects. It's simple, so it's easy to understand.

So, after this analysis, I will use something like ""The square filled with grey dots"". This description is efficient, precise, and most importantly, *unambiguous* in this context. It's concise and effectively targets the distinguishing properties of the target object.
"
exp2_104.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,2,circle,green,stripe,"2,3",Select the circle with vertical stripes.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game and need to describe this target object so the listener can pick it out. Let's break it down methodically. First, I need to analyze the image. I see a 3x3 grid, and three objects are visible, positioned at the bottom and middle rows. The target is a circle with a red dashed box, it's in the bottom row, center.

My goal is to provide a good, distinguishing description. I've identified the objects: a circle with green border and wavy grey lines on the bottom left (distractor 1), the target circle with a green border and grey vertical stripes on the bottom center (the target), and a star with a black border and vertical grey stripes on the middle right (distractor 2).

Now, what’s unique about the target? I could focus on shape, pattern, border color, or some combination. Let's consider a few strategies.

1.  **Shape and Pattern:** ""The target is a circle with vertical stripes."" Seems promising. It uniquely identifies the object since the other circle has wavy stripes and the star isn't a circle.

2.  **Shape and Border Color:** ""The target is a circle with a green border."" Not good enough. There's another green-bordered circle.

3.  **Pattern and Border Color:** ""The target has vertical stripes and a green border."" This works. The star has vertical stripes but a black border.

4.  **Single Features:** ""The target is a circle,"" ""The target has vertical stripes,"" ""The target has a green border."" None of these work alone, so I need at least two attributes.

Comparing the shape/pattern strategy (""The target is a circle with vertical stripes"") with the pattern/border color (""The target has vertical stripes and a green border""), I think the shape/pattern combination is more concise and natural. ""Circle with vertical stripes"" flows better. I want to be concise without sacrificing clarity.

Let's refine it. How about ""Select the circle that has vertical stripes inside?"" That makes it extra clear and unambiguous. And it avoids using spatial locations, which is a key requirement in this reference game.

I need to think about potential ambiguities. The listener might confuse ""wavy"" with ""vertical"" or ""circle"" with ""star."" The description ""the circle with vertical stripes"" is robust because it offers a way to eliminate possible confusions. If they focus on ""circle"", they select two objects and then see the stripes in the target to make the final determination. If they focus on ""vertical stripes"", they select two objects and then look for a circle to determine the target.

The distinguishing features are, therefore, Shape: Circle (vs. Star) and Pattern: Vertical stripes (vs. Wavy lines). Combining these two features is crucial.

But should I add the color? ""The green circle with vertical stripes,"" or ""The green-bordered object with vertical stripes"" also works, but I don't know that it's *better*. ""Circle"" feels like a more essential characteristic than ""green-bordered"" and is probably easier for a listener to identify. The color might be a secondary filter. ""The circle with vertical stripes"" is all I need.

I’m confident that the simplest description is often the best. It's concise, unambiguous, and solely relies on the object's inherent features. No spatial references, no extra fluff.

Let’s quickly double-check the constraints of the prompt:

*   I am the speaker: Check.
*   No degenerate spatial locations: Check, I am using features.
*   The target image is highlighted with a dashed red box. I've accounted for this.
*   Some objects might be hidden - not in the current image.

""The circle with vertical stripes."" That's the one. Let's go with it.

exp2_105.jpeg,cond4,present,present,3,triangle,black,dot,"2,1",The triangle that is filled with dots.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being asked to be the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: describe the object inside that red dashed box in a way that allows another person to pinpoint it. No problem. Let's break this down systematically.

First, I need to take a good look at the image. It's a 3x3 grid. I see some empty cells, and immediately I notice two triangles in the top row. One has vertical stripes and the other dots, which is the object of my desire. The bottom row has that red curtain with question marks. That's a bit of a wildcard, but I'll deal with what I *can* see. The middle row is empty.

Now, to really hone in on the target, the one with the dots. It’s a triangle, outlined in thick black. The defining characteristic? Those grey dots fill the inside. Right, that's the key. I need to make sure this stands out from any other object in view.

I've got a distractor. The other triangle also has a thick black outline, but it’s filled with vertical grey stripes. And those unknown objects behind the curtain? I'm not going to speculate. My responsibility as the speaker is to describe the *visible* objects.

Therefore, my description needs to be precise and unambiguous. I want to avoid using any positional language like ""the one on the right"" because the arrangement could be changed. The best thing is to focus on the unique identifying feature. ""The triangle filled with dots,"" that should do the trick, right? I am betting on that pattern being sufficiently distinct that a person wouldn’t confuse the two, given that that other triangle has vertical stripes.

I can refine this. ""It's a triangle with a dotted pattern inside."" That's also good and gets the same point across. Or I could say something like, ""Select the triangle that has dots inside it, not the one with stripes,"" explicitly calling out the distractor.

But, after weighing the options, I'm going with simple and direct. ""The triangle that is filled with dots."" It's concise, accurate, and highlights the crucial difference. Hopefully, that will get the message across to my audience.
"
exp2_106.jpeg,cond4,present,present,4,triangle,green,dot,"2,1",It's the triangle with a green border that is filled with grey dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game, and my goal is to describe a specific object so the listener can identify it. I'm given an image with a 3x3 grid, but only some cells are filled. My task is to describe the triangle with a green border and filled with a grid of grey dots. This is the target, indicated by the dashed red box.

First, I need to analyze the situation. The listener sees the objects, but the arrangement could be different. Therefore, I can't use terms like ""top left"" or ""middle object."" I know what's *visible* and what's *hidden* behind the red curtains. The listener also knows what's hidden, but I do not.

The visible objects consist of:
1.  A blue-bordered square filled with grey dots.
2.  My target: A green-bordered triangle filled with grey dots.
3.  A green-bordered triangle filled with a grey and white checkerboard pattern.
4.  There are unknown objects behind a red curtain.

I need to focus on what makes the target unique. What are its defining characteristics? I see:

*   Shape: Triangle.
*   Border color: Green.
*   Fill pattern: Grey dots.

Now, I consider how to distinguish the target from the other visible objects.

*   **Target vs. Square:** Shape and border color are the easy differentiators. A triangle and a green border will separate it from a square with a blue border. Though, both have grey dots.
*   **Target vs. Triangle with Checkerboard:** Both are triangles, and have green borders. The key difference is the fill pattern: grey dots versus a checkerboard pattern.

How can I formulate this description effectively? I'm thinking, I should start with the most distinctive feature:

1.  Shape: ""It's a triangle."" This narrows it down to the two triangles.
2.  To differentiate the target from the checkerboard triangle, add the fill pattern: ""It's filled with grey dots.""

However, there's a catch: the hidden objects. Could there be *another* triangle filled with grey dots? Possibly, yes. So, to ensure clarity and robustness, I should be more explicit. I can improve my description:

*   ""It's a triangle with a green border that's filled with grey dots.""

Now, let's assess this description. I'm confident with it.

*   Shape: ""Triangle"" – It distinguishes the target from the square.
*   Border color: ""Green"" – This further differentiates from the square, but it's consistent with the second triangle.
*   Fill pattern: ""Grey dots"" – This is what sets the target apart from the checkerboard triangle.

This combination (triangle, green border, grey dots) should be very specific. This description minimizes the risk of confusion with any hidden objects, even if there is an object behind the curtain with similar features. It's the best I can do with the information I have.

Let me produce a few options:

*   Option 1 (Concise): ""It's the triangle that's filled with grey dots."" This is simpler but relies on the listener seeing and interpreting the difference based on the other visible triangle.
*   Option 2 (Comprehensive): ""The object is a triangle with a green border, and it's filled with a pattern of grey dots."" This is the most precise and complete option and will reduce uncertainty.
*   Option 3 (Comparative): ""There are two triangles with green borders. I'm talking about the one that has grey dots inside, not the one with the checkerboard pattern."" This can be too conversational.

Considering my experience in describing complex situations, Option 2 is the most appropriate. I will choose it, but slightly rephrased for natural language flow.

My definitive description: ""The target is the triangle with a green border that is filled with grey dots.""

I think this description is sound.

Now let me test this final description.

*   Target: Triangle, green border, grey dots.
*   Competitor 1: Square, blue border, grey dots.
*   Competitor 2: Triangle, green border, checkerboard.
*   Hidden objects: Unknown.

My description: ""a triangle with a green border that is filled with grey dots"".

*   ""triangle"" excludes Competitor 1 (the square).
*   ""filled with grey dots"" excludes Competitor 2 (the checkerboard triangle).
*   ""triangle"", ""green border"" and ""grey dots"" in combination minimizes chances of confusion with any object behind the curtain.

Yes, this is a solid, unambiguous description. It doesn"
exp2_107.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,triangle,red,wavy,"3,3",It's the triangle with a red outline.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game and need to describe this target object for someone else to identify. Let's break this down. First, I see a 3x2 grid with various shapes, colors, and internal patterns. The target is a red-outlined triangle with grey and white wavy lines. My job is to describe this uniquely.

I can't just say ""the bottom right object"" because the layout might change for the listener. I need a robust description based purely on the object's features. Thinking like a good speaker, I need to make the description precise, while being as concise as possible.

Initially, I thought just saying ""It's a triangle"" might be enough, because it's the only triangle in sight. It's a strong start. But, I don't know what the other person might see. What if there's another triangle they see? I need to build a robust description.

So, I could say ""It's the triangle with a red outline,"" which is better. Or ""It's the triangle with the wavy grey and white pattern."" These combinations of shape and color/pattern make them unique among the visible objects.

I considered combining all the features: ""It's the triangle with a red outline and a wavy grey and white pattern inside."" This is very specific, but maybe too wordy? Perhaps the goal is to be concise?

Then I went back to just the shape, ""It's the triangle."" Simple, straightforward. But that feels a bit risky if there's *any* other triangle in the listener's view.

To be on the safe side, let's include another feature. I think ""The triangle with the red outline"" is probably the best. The term ""red"" is a more basic concept than ""wavy pattern,"" making it quicker and easier to understand.

Ultimately, I think the *best* description, the one that balances clarity and brevity is ""The triangle with the red outline."" It's specific enough to distinguish it from the other objects, yet concise enough to be readily understood. The key is to convey the unique combination of features in a way that minimizes ambiguity. It's a good description, that provides a clear reference!

exp2_108.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,4,square,red,wavy,"1,3",It's the square with the grey wavy pattern inside.,"**Analyzing the Target for Accurate Reference**

Okay, so I'm being asked to describe an object within this image so someone else can identify it. The red dashed box shows me the target. My goal is to craft a description that's precise enough for unambiguous identification, while *not* relying on spatial references (like ""bottom left"") that might be misleading to the other person. They see something different and the positions of objects might be altered. Critically, there are also items hidden behind these red curtains with question marks. I don't know what they are, and the other person *does*, so I need to be extra cautious.

First, I observe the features of the target object. It's a square. It has a red border. Inside, there's a grey wavy line pattern. That's a good starting point. I look at the visible objects; there are circles with different borders and patterns, specifically, a blue-bordered circle with a wavy pattern, a red-bordered circle with stripes, and a red-bordered circle with polka dots. I can use these visual distinctions to help me formulate my description of the square. I have to consider the hidden objects.

Okay, let's play this out. I initially think, ""It's the square with the wavy pattern."" That seems pretty good, right? However, I'm thinking about that ""square"" identifier. Is it safe? I need to make sure that another square isn't behind the curtain. The shapes are distinct; only one object is a square so far. If a hidden object is a square, the simple phrase ""the square"" won't be enough. The phrase ""the square with the wavy pattern"" is better. So the phrase that includes the shape is better because it reduces potential ambiguities.

I can break down the features further: *Shape: Square*. That is unique among the visible objects. The border color is *red*. But I see two red bordered objects, so that alone isn't sufficient. The inside pattern is *grey wavy lines*. I see that pattern on the blue-bordered circle. So, the feature ""wavy lines"" is not enough, on its own.

Now I can combine these: ""the square with the red border and grey wavy lines."" That sounds very specific. Or, ""the red square with the wavy pattern."" That's also good. I'm trying to make the description *robust*. Is the phrase ""square with the wavy pattern"" the best? Let's consider whether the phrase ""it's the only square"" will work. I don't know if another square is hidden, so I should combine the features. I have to think about what is behind the curtains. I might be able to create an ambiguity, in the target description, if I'm not careful. Let's start with ""the object with the wavy pattern and a red border.""

I can now check for ambiguities. There is another object with a wavy pattern (the blue circle), but its border is blue. There are also objects with red borders (striped and dotted circles) but they don't have a wavy pattern. This seems like a unique descriptor amongst the visible objects.

The other descriptor is ""the square with the wavy pattern."" Now, again, I check for ambiguity. The other object with a wavy pattern is a circle, so that is okay. Both descriptions seem to work, right? The shape (""square"") is unique, *among visible items*. I need to think about what could be hidden. If there is a hidden object that is a ""red square with a different pattern"", then ""the square with the wavy pattern"" is okay. If there is a *blue square with a wavy pattern* hidden, then it would still work. If there is a red circle with a wavy pattern, then it would still work. The only thing that breaks the second description is another *square with a wavy pattern* behind a curtain. Now, the first descriptor, ""the object with the wavy pattern and a red border,"" it could be ambiguous if there is a *circle with a wavy pattern and red border.*

Which ambiguity is more likely to have been designed into the puzzle? It is hard to say. The shape is the strongest visual cue that can differentiate it from all the other shapes. I should include the pattern and the color as well. So, I will choose the phrase, ""The square with the wavy pattern,"" and maybe make it more specific: ""The red-bordered square with the wavy pattern."" That could be too much.

I try other options: ""the square with grey wavy lines"", or just ""the square object"" (risky). It is best to choose a description that combines the *most salient* features. So the best features will be, first, ""square"" (differentiates from all others); second, the ""wavy"" pattern (differentiates from the striped and dotted circles"
exp2_109.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,triangle,red,dot,"3,3",It's the triangle with a red outline and grey polka dots.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My task is to describe this object so the listener can pick it out. Let's break this down systematically. First, I need to *analyze* the visual information. I see a 3x3 grid. The top row is empty. The middle row has a star with a black outline and grey polka dots. The bottom row is where the action is. There's a target object, and two hidden objects behind curtains with question marks. That means I have to be careful not to make assumptions about uniqueness, like ""the only triangle.""

Next, I *identify* the target object itself. It's a triangle, with a red outline and filled with grey polka dots on a white background. I also need to note any *distractors* or visible similar objects, which in this case is the star. It's also polka-dotted, but has a black outline. Then, I remember I have to think about the *hidden objects*, which are the tricky part because I don't know what they are.

Now, for the description. I need to focus on what makes the target object unique. The most obvious things are shape, outline color, and fill. I initially consider just ""It's a triangle."" But that's probably too vague with hidden objects in play. The red outline is a good characteristic. So is the grey polka-dot fill, which it shares with the star. Combining these: ""It's a triangle with a red outline."" That's better. But should I add the fill pattern as well? The star has the same fill pattern, so that part isn't a distinguishing feature *from the star*, but it *is* a feature of the target. ""It's a triangle with a red outline and grey polka dots."" That seems pretty robust.

I then start to refine. ""The object is a triangle with a red outline and is filled with grey polka dots."" It's good, but can I be simpler? ""The polka-dotted triangle"" and ""The red-outlined triangle"" are short, but might not be specific enough. I need to make the description safe. Combining the features, I'm leaning toward ""It's the triangle with the red outline and polka dot fill."" Is that the best? Perhaps...

I compare the object to the star, thinking about what is different and similar between them. Mentioning the black outline and the red outline for the star and triangle respectively seems like a good method.

Finally, I want the description to be *precise* and *concise*, without using any spatial references. I also need to ensure that the listener is able to identify the object even if the hidden objects are relevant. ""It's the triangle with the red outline and grey polka dots."" is my current frontrunner. I then decide to slightly change the sentence structure for fluidity. I'll test it one last time, making sure I haven't missed any opportunities for clarity. Then I arrive at the final option. ""It's the triangle with the red outline and grey polka dots."" It is concise and specific, so that should be my final choice.

exp2_110.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,2,triangle,green,dot,"2,3",The triangle with the green outline.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game and need to describe an object so someone can pick it out. The image is a 3x3 grid, and there are three objects visible. Let's break this down.

First, I analyze the visual elements. There's a triangle in the top-left with a black outline and grey dots inside. The target, the thing I need to describe, is a triangle in the bottom-middle with a green outline and the same grey dot fill. Finally, there's a blue-outlined circle with a wavy grey and white pattern in the bottom-right. No hidden objects, got it.

My primary task is clear: isolate the target, the green-outlined triangle. It's crucial to identify the relevant features. The fill pattern (grey dots) is common to the target and a distractor. The shape (triangle) is also common, which means I need to make sure to contrast the two objects that are the same shape. The color of the outline is the key difference between the target and the other triangle.

Now, I start to formulate a referring expression. The goal is to disambiguate. The other triangle is a distractor, and it has a black outline. The circle has a blue outline. I need something that will easily distinguish the target from the distractors.

Let's see: ""The green triangle""? Unique. ""The triangle with the green outline""? Also unique and perhaps slightly more precise. ""The dotted triangle with the green outline"" is another option, though possibly redundant. Since I was told not to use spatial descriptions, I need to stay away from anything like ""the triangle in the bottom middle.""

Okay, let's look at it. ""The green triangle"" works as a concise description, but ""the triangle with the green outline"" is more precise. Since there's only one green thing on the grid, that should be enough. The dot pattern is relevant to the *type* of object and may be redundant.

Combining the essential features: shape and color. ""The triangle with the green outline."" I can confirm the listener has correctly identified the *type* of object if I mention the fill, but I don't need to. ""The triangle with the green outline"" seems perfect. It’s concise, unambiguous, and, most importantly, uniquely identifies the target, even to a novice.

Final Check: This expression uniquely identifies the target. No spatial language is used. It's concise. It's easy to understand. So, the description is ""The triangle with the green outline.""
"
exp2_111.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,triangle,green,wavy,"3,1",It's the triangle with a green outline.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My task is to describe this target object so someone else can pick it out from a set of distractors. First, I need to *really* look at what I'm given. There's a 3x2 grid. I see shapes with patterns, and I'm focusing on the target object, highlighted in red.

Alright, the target is in the top row, second column. It's a triangle. It has a green outline, and the inside has a grey and white wavy pattern. Now, let's quickly check the other objects – these are crucial for comparison. There's a red-outlined square with a checkerboard, a black-outlined circle with stripes, a black-outlined square with the same wavy pattern as the target (uh oh!), and another black-outlined circle, also with the wavy pattern.

The prompt says *not* to use spatial terms like ""top-right,"" which makes sense - the other person might see things arranged differently. No red curtains here (this is good, less to think about!).

I need a description that's *unique* and easy to understand. ""The triangle with a green outline and a wavy pattern inside"" seems a bit long-winded, although complete. I want to be *efficient* too.

I'm thinking: is ""The triangle"" enough? Yes, it *is* a unique shape in the grid. What about ""The green outlined object?"" Also sufficient because the color is unique. However, let's explore this further - is the pattern a good differentiator? Nope, there are other objects with wavy patterns, so I need to be careful.

Let's make a summary table of properties!
*   **Object 1:** Square, Red, Checkerboard
*   **Target:** Triangle, Green, Wavy
*   **Object 3:** Circle, Black, Stripes
*   **Object 4:** Square, Black, Wavy
*   **Object 5:** Circle, Black, Wavy

Now the summary table has made it even more obvious! ""Triangle"" is a unique shape. ""Green outline"" is a unique outline. Wavy pattern is shared with the square and the circle.

So, the optimal description combines the unique features. ""It's the triangle with the green outline"" should be robust. It uses the best, most salient features to pick the object. No need for the ""wavy"" description! ""It is a triangle with a green outline"" will do! I think that's the best option here; clear and concise, without any ambiguity.
"
exp2_112.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,circle,black,wavy,"3,2",The circle with the wavy pattern inside.,"**My Thought Process: Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with acting as a speaker in a reference game. My primary objective is clear: describe the highlighted object in the image in such a way that the listener can accurately select it. I need to be as precise as possible, avoiding ambiguity.

First, I need to thoroughly *analyze* the visual information. I see a 3x3 grid, though not all cells are occupied. Within this grid, there are different shapes – triangles, circles, and a square – and each has a distinct pattern – checkerboard, polka dots, and wavy lines. The outlines are either black or red. I must remember that the listener's view might not be identical to mine, therefore I cannot rely on spatial locations like ""top right"". The general instructions mentioned the potential for hidden objects (like red curtains with question marks), though that's not present here; I am to describe the objects I *can* see.

Next, I *identify* the specific target. The dashed red box clearly highlights a circle. This circle has a black outline and a gray and white wavy line pattern within it. It's located in the middle row, rightmost column of the grid.

Now, I *identify the distractors* – the objects that are not the target. I've noted them as follows: a triangle with a black outline and a checkerboard pattern, a circle with a red outline and a polka dot pattern, a square with a black outline and a polka dot pattern, and a triangle with a black outline and a wavy line pattern.

The critical step is to *formulate a descriptive utterance*. I need to find the unique features that, when combined, will differentiate the target from the distractors. I considered:

*   **Shape:** It's a circle. But there's another circle! That alone is not enough.
*   **Pattern:** The target has a wavy line pattern. But there is also a triangle with this same pattern. So, the pattern alone will not work.
*   **Outline color:** It has a black outline, but multiple objects have that feature. This won't work alone.

Therefore, I must *combine these features* for a unique description. I considered several options:

*   ""The circle with the wavy pattern."" I checked. Is there another circle with a wavy pattern? No. This seems good. But, there is a triangle with a wavy pattern, so this by itself might be ambiguous if I don't clarify the shape.
*   ""The circle with the black outline."" I'm also fairly sure this would be good. The other circle has a red outline.
*   I weighed both descriptions. The ""wavy pattern"" seems to me to be a more salient visual feature, though the outline color is quite clear.
*   I looked at options like ""The black-outlined circle with the wavy pattern."" This is very specific but maybe a bit long.

I considered the following potential descriptions:

*   ""The circle with the wavy pattern.""
*   ""The circle with the black outline.""
*   ""The black-outlined circle with the wavy pattern.""

In the end, I analyzed all the objects present:
*   Target: Circle, black outline, wavy pattern.
*   Distractor 1: Circle, red outline, polka dot pattern.
*   Distractor 2: Triangle, black outline, wavy pattern.
*   Distractor 3: Square, black outline, polka dot pattern.
*   Distractor 4: Triangle, black outline, checkerboard pattern.

I considered that if I say ""The circle with the wavy pattern"", the listener would only need to check the two circles. One has polka dots, one has wavy lines. They'd pick the wavy one. I thought that ""The circle with the black outline"", would be good too, and require the listener to check the two circles as well.

I determined that ""the circle with the wavy pattern"" is sufficient and minimal.

Finally, I *constructed the utterance*. I considered starting with ""There is a circle..."" or ""Select the circle..."" I decided to go with ""The circle with the wavy pattern"" as a clear and concise option. The other object with a wavy pattern is a triangle and the other circle has polka dots, so ""circle"" and ""wavy pattern"" uniquely identifies the target. It's a solid choice.

exp2_113.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,circle,red,wavy,"3,2",It's the circle with a red border that contains a gray and white wavy pattern.,"**My Strategy for Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm in a reference game. My task is to describe this object so that someone else can pinpoint it. I'm looking at a 3x3 grid, and I'm seeing a few things right away. Some cells are empty, some have objects, and some are hidden behind red curtains with question marks – I can't see what's behind those curtains, so they don't influence my description directly. The target is clearly marked with a dashed red box.

First, I need to analyze the image and identify the objects I can see. I've got a triangle with a checkerboard pattern, and then, the target, a circle with a red outline and a wavy gray and white pattern inside.  There are also some empty cells and curtains, which are irrelevant to the target description.

Now comes the crucial part: formulating the referring expression. I need to make sure my description uniquely identifies the target, differentiating it from the triangle and whatever might be hidden. Since I can't see the hidden objects, I need to focus on the features I *can* see. Spatial locations are out, as the listener may have a different arrangement.

The most salient features of the target object are its shape (circle), the pattern (wavy), and the colors (red, gray, and white). I have to avoid making assumptions about the hidden objects.

I considered a few options. I could say ""It's the circle with a red outline and a wavy pattern inside,"" which is pretty straightforward and accurate. I could use contrast: ""I see a triangle with a checkerboard pattern and a circle with a wavy pattern. The target is the circle."" But that could be overly verbose, and assume the listener sees the visible triangle. So, I need to find the most concise description to distinguish the target. The best option is, ""It's a circle with a red outline. Inside the circle is a wavy gray and white pattern."" I'm describing the circle, and the pattern inside it. I can't be sure, but I believe that's enough to avoid confusing the target and other objects.

To be concise, it seems that ""The circle with the wavy pattern inside."" is a solid description. It contrasts well with the triangle. I'll stick with ""It's a circle with a red outline. Inside the circle is a wavy gray and white pattern."" This is what the listener needs to hear to identify the object.
"
exp2_114.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,2,square,red,wavy,"1,2",The object that is a square with a wavy pattern inside.,"**My Analysis of the Reference Game**

Okay, so I'm presented with a 3x3 grid containing three distinct objects. My task, as I understand it, is to clearly identify the target object so the user can select it. This is a classic reference game setup. The key is to produce an unambiguous description.

First, I need to break down the visual components. There are three objects: a green star with vertical stripes (top-right), a red star with a checkerboard (bottom-middle), and my target: a square with a red border, and a gray and white wavy line pattern inside (middle-left, highlighted).

The critical thing here is to focus on distinctive features. Spatial location is off-limits due to the game rules, and there is no curtain to account for in this round. Shape and the pattern are clearly my main differentiators. One's a square; the others are stars. The target has a unique wavy pattern. The stars have stripes and a checkerboard, respectively.

My initial approach is to craft a description that leverages these unique attributes. The primary strategy is to distinguish the square from the stars using their shapes, followed by the wavy pattern, as it is the most unique pattern of the three. Let's see... ""The square with the wavy pattern."" That's concise and directly hits the mark. The red border seems like it could create an ambiguity due to the second object also sharing this feature; it should be avoided, and not mentioned.

Considering the simplicity and effectiveness, I can also say “Select the square with the wavy pattern”. I could further say: ""The object that is a square and not a star"". However, let's keep the focus on what the object *is*, not what it *isn't*.

So, my final refined description is: “The square with the wavy lines inside.” It's clear, concise, and unambiguously identifies the target. It leverages the square shape and the wavy pattern. That's a strong, unambiguous description. It's safe to present this.
"
exp2_115.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,4,triangle,green,dot,"3,3",The object to select is the triangle that is filled with dots.,"**Analyzing the Image for Effective Reference**

Okay, here's the task: I need to describe a target object in an image so that someone can pick it out. The target is clearly highlighted.

First, I'm going to break down the image. I have a dashed red box around the target: a triangle. Its outline is green, and the fill pattern is grey dots. There are a few other objects: a red-outlined circle with a grey wavy pattern, a red-outlined square with grey dots, a black-outlined star with grey stripes, and a blue-outlined triangle with grey stripes. There are also empty cells, which are not relevant for now, given that I don't see any hidden objects.

My goal is to create a description that uniquely identifies the target, the green triangle with dots. I have to think about how to differentiate the target from each of the other objects. The circle is easy, it's a circle and has waves. The square shares the dots, but is a square and has a red outline, not a green triangle. The star is a star, with stripes and a black border, it's also easy to differentiate. The trickiest distractor is the blue-outlined triangle with stripes. They're both triangles! I have to be precise: the outline is green, and the pattern inside is dots.

To make sure my description is effective, I need to focus on what makes the target unique. ""The green triangle"" works immediately because there's only one green shape. Similarly, ""the triangle with dots inside"" works because the other triangle has stripes. ""The shape with a green outline"" also works. I can also combine these into ""The triangle with a green outline and a dotted pattern inside.""

I want to be concise, yet clear. ""The green triangle"" is simple, but ""the triangle with dots"" is also good, directly contrasting with the striped triangle. ""The green object"" is not ideal, as it doesn't specify shape. ""The object with dots"" is also too ambiguous because it could be the square.

I'm thinking: The best strategy is to be as specific as possible. The pattern and shape are shared, and the color is unique. Combining the pattern and shape is key. Therefore, either ""The triangle with a green border"" or ""The triangle with dots"" will work.

Ultimately, I want a description that's both efficient and unambiguous. I'm going to go with ""The triangle with a green outline"" or ""Select the triangle that has dots inside,"" but, to be specific, I will use ""The triangle filled with dots"" to make the intent clear and contrast with the ""triangle filled with stripes"".
"
exp2_116.jpeg,cond3,present,absent,2,star,black,stripe,"3,3",It's a star with a black outline that is filled with vertical stripes.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, here's how I'm thinking through this ""speaker"" role. The goal is clear: describe this target object so the listener can pick it out from the grid. I'm focusing on features that will *uniquely* identify the target, considering there might be other items hidden from my view, and avoiding any spatial language that might not be universal for the listener.

First, I need to understand what I'm looking at. I see a 3x3 grid, some filled cells, some empty, and the target highlighted with a red box. The target is a five-pointed star – that's the base shape. It's got a thick, black outline. Inside, it's filled with alternating gray and white vertical stripes. There's also a green-outlined triangle with wavy gray lines above the target, which I can use for contrast. However, I can't say something like ""the star *below* the triangle"" because I need to consider that the listener might have a different grid layout. There are also two cells covered by red curtains with white question marks, so I need to make my description specific enough to distinguish the target even if there's something *similar* behind those curtains.

So, I need to come up with a description that's not just *a* star, but *this* star. I need to distill its features: it's a star; its outline is thick and black; it has a fill pattern of vertical stripes. The visible distractor (the triangle) is easy to eliminate because its shape, outline color, and fill are all different. The real challenge is the unknown items behind the curtains.

I can start with ""It's a star"" – but that's potentially too generic. Then, ""It's the object with vertical stripes"" – that's better, but still could be ambiguous. The best approach is to combine features: shape, outline, and fill pattern. I need to ensure it's distinct from any hidden objects.

So, I'll go through the descriptions. I'll need to combine the most defining aspects of the star to distinguish it. I will land on something like, ""It's a star with a thick black outline, filled with vertical gray and white stripes."" This is clear. Or, perhaps, ""The star with vertical stripes"". Or I could add the outline into the mix. So, ""It's a star with a black outline that is filled with vertical stripes."" I think this is robust.

Let's stick with that final one; it's concise, unambiguous, and covers all the key distinguishing characteristics.
"
exp2_117.jpeg,cond4,present,present,2,star,black,wavy,"3,3",The star with the black outline and wavy lines inside.,"**My Approach to Describing the Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing the role of the speaker in this reference game. My objective is crystal clear: to guide the other person to select the correct object from the 3x3 grid. The tricky part? They have access to information that I might not. Specifically, they can see behind those question mark-laden red curtains, and I can't. So, I need to craft my description carefully, avoiding any assumptions about shared spatial positions or potentially hidden objects.

First, I've got to analyze what's visible. I see a 3x3 grid. The top and middle rows have empty spaces and two red curtains. The bottom row presents a green star with vertical grey stripes, an empty cell, and a black star. The target object, which I can see thanks to the red dashed box around it, is the black star.

Next, I zero in on describing the target, which, now I know, is a black star. It's a five-pointed star with a thick black outline, and the pattern inside consists of wavy, horizontal, grey lines.

I need to compare that to the other visible object: the green star. This star has a green outline and vertical grey stripes. Crucially, the other person can see behind the curtains, so I have to assume they may have other objects in view that I cannot see.

To formulate the description, I need to make the target star uniquely identifiable. Both objects are stars, both have patterns. The key to differentiation is the outline color (black vs. green) and the internal pattern (wavy vs. vertical). I can use either or both of these to create a distinct description.

So, I need to be precise, especially because I don't know what's behind the curtains. I'm going to consider possible distractors. What if there is another black-outlined star? What if there's a star with a wavy pattern, but a different outline color? I need to refine my description to handle these possibilities.

""The star with the wavy grey lines inside"" - this feels quite precise, as the other star has straight lines. Equally, ""The star with the black outline"" is also solid, because the other star is green. I need to be concise yet unambiguous. I like, ""It's a star with a black outline and a wavy pattern inside."" That should do the trick, even if there are multiple objects.

Finally, I'm going to choose a description that mentions shape, outline color, and pattern. I'll combine these features to minimize ambiguity. My description will include the shape, outline color, and pattern. Thus, my final sentence is: ""Select the star that has a black outline and is filled with wavy lines."" It's clear, avoids spatial language, and uses multiple features, so the other person has the best chance of selecting the correct target.
"
exp2_118.jpeg,cond2,absent,present,3,star,black,dot,"3,1",The star filled with dots.,"**My Thought Process: Selecting the Target Object**

Okay, so I need to describe a target object in a reference game. My goal is to be precise enough so the other person can identify the object without any ambiguity. Let's analyze. The target is inside a dashed red box. It's a five-pointed star with a black outline and a pattern of grey dots on a white background inside. It’s in a 3x3 grid, and I need to consider all the other objects in that grid.

There are a few other shapes present. There's a square with a green border, filled with grey dots. Then there's a triangle with a red border, filled with a grey and white checkerboard pattern, and another star – also five-pointed – with a green border, filled with a grey wavy line pattern. There are empty cells in the grid, but I'm told to ignore the possibility of other hidden objects.

Now, what makes the target unique? Well, it's a star, like one other item. But the target's black outline is different from the other star's green outline. And the dotted interior is different from the wavy lines inside the other star. The square also has dots, but it's not a star, so the target has a black outline with dots, so it is the only object in the set with *that* combination.

So, how do I describe this? I need to be concise, unambiguous, and avoid positional references like ""top right,"" in case the arrangement changes in future instances. ""The black star"" is simple. Will it work? It should. The other star is green. The ""star filled with dots"" is also good, but the green square has dots. The combination of shape and outline color or pattern seems to be strong.

Let's brainstorm a few descriptions. ""The black star"" is concise, but is it clear enough? ""The star with the black outline"" is slightly more descriptive. ""The star filled with dots"" is also workable. I could get more detailed: ""The star with a black outline and a grey dotted pattern inside."" But is that overkill? I could also say, ""The black star with dots inside"".

I think ""The black star"" is the most efficient and clear descriptor given the presence of the other objects. The listener sees two stars. One is green, one is black. ""The black star"" is immediately clear. ""The star filled with dots"" is similarly clear. The fill pattern (dots vs. wavy lines) is a good distinguishing feature and also the black outline.

So, comparing my options, ""The black star"" seems excellent. It's the most direct. The listener will quickly see the distinction. ""The star filled with dots"" also works because the other star has wavy lines. Both are solid options. Let's make sure, just to be precise, I could say ""Select the star filled with dots"" or ""Select the black star"". ""The star with the black outline"". I think I'll go with ""The star filled with dots."" It has good visual distinction, especially compared to the other star.

exp2_119.jpeg,cond1,absent,absent,4,triangle,red,dot,"1,2",Select the red triangle with the gray polka dot pattern.,"**My Thought Process: Describing a Target Object**

Okay, so I'm playing a reference game. My task is to describe this target object so someone else can pick it out from a set of distractors. First, I need to understand the visual layout. It's a 3x3 grid, but only the bottom two rows have objects. My focus is on the object in the top-left cell, which is highlighted by a dashed red box. The prompt is designed for me, because this highlighting is only visible to me. I need to make sure my description reflects only what the *listener* can see, so I'll ignore the highlighting.

Now, let's break down the target: It's a triangle. Its outline is red, and it's filled with grey polka dots on a white background. Now I need to consider the other objects. There's a blue-outlined striped square, a black-outlined circle with a wavy pattern, a black-outlined polka dot square, and another black-outlined square with a wavy pattern.

My strategy is to find features that uniquely identify the target. The most obvious is its shape: it's the only triangle. The red outline is also unique. While it has polka dots, there's another object with the same fill. So, just saying ""the object with polka dots"" would be ambiguous.

I'm thinking, ""Is the shape sufficient? ""The object is a triangle"" seems the simplest and safest bet. Or, should I include the color? ""The object with a red outline"" also works. Or do I combine both for extra clarity? ""The red triangle"". This might be the most robust choice.

Now, from the listener's perspective, I must be clear and unique. Because I need to avoid any potential ambiguity due to spatial reference, such as ""top left shape.""

Okay, let's evaluate: ""It's the triangle"" – is that enough? Yes, there's only one. ""It's the one with the red border"" – also works. Okay, let's combine: ""It's a red triangle"". I feel good about that. To be extra safe, I could also say ""It's the red triangle with a polka dot pattern"". This is probably the most complete and precise description.

Ultimately, simplicity is key, but I want to make sure the listener understands me perfectly. It's unique to the triangle and unique to the red. So, I will say ""Select the red triangle."" That's concise, accurate, and eliminates any potential for misinterpretation.

Okay, the goal is clear: to describe an object within this grid so that someone else can identify it. This isn't just about naming the object; it's about providing enough distinguishing information that it's uniquely identifiable. So, my initial thought is to break down the problem methodically.

First, I need to *analyze the image* thoroughly. The image is a 3x3 grid. I see some empty cells, the target cell with the vertical grey and white stripes within the blue border (that's the one marked by the red box), and a checkerboard pattern with a green border in another cell. Two other cells are hidden behind red curtains with question marks. Those hidden cells are a critical consideration.

Next, *identify the target object.* That's easy; it’s the cell with the vertical stripes and the blue border. Done.

Then, I must *identify the distractors*. There's the obvious checkerboard pattern. But critically, there are also those hidden objects. I need a description that is very unlikely to be confused with *anything* in the grid, visible or hidden. This is where I start thinking about crafting an effective description.

Now, it's time to *formulate a description*. It has to be precise. It cannot rely on the position. Therefore, I'll need to focus on its key *visual features.*

The primary visual features of the *target* object are: the pattern of vertical stripes, the grey (and white/light grey, depending on the observer) color of the stripes, and the blue color of the border.

Now, I'm going to *compare the target with the distractors* to refine my thinking. The main visible distractor is the checkerboard, but I need to consider what could possibly be behind the curtains.

Okay, let's *draft some potential descriptions* and evaluate them.

*   ""The one with the vertical stripes."" - This is a good starting point, highlighting a key difference. But... what if a hidden object *also* has stripes?
*   ""The one with the blue border."" - Again, a good differentiator, contrasting with the green border of the checkerboard. But the same risk applies to the hidden objects.
*   ""The square with vertical grey stripes and a blue border."" - Ah, now we're talking. This description is more complete. That combines two defining features, making confusion less likely.
*   ""The square with the blue frame contains vertical gray stripes."" - This another phrasing of the description, but conveys the same information.
*   ""It's the square with the vertical lines inside, not the checkerboard."" - This is a good approach, but I prefer positive descriptions and should stick to positive features.

Now, I'm at the point of *selecting the best description*. The best option combines multiple unique features. It would be: ""The square with vertical grey stripes and a blue border"". I'll consider if I can simplify it a bit without losing clarity. The pattern of vertical stripes is more important to communicate over grey coloring. I can go with ""The square with the vertical stripes and a blue border,"" or ""The square with the blue border has vertical grey stripes inside.""

Therefore, for the sake of clarity and simplicity: ""The square with the blue border and vertical stripes.""

The pattern (vertical stripes) is a key feature, different from the checkerboard. The border color (blue) is another strong one, different from the green border. Combining the features is the safest bet for clarity.

*   *Check* Does it use location? No.
*   Is it clear? Yes.
*   Is it specific enough to distinguish from the visible distractors? Yes.
*   Is it specific enough to likely distinguish from the hidden objects? Yes, by combining two key features.

My final conclusion: The most concise and effective description is ""The square with the blue border and vertical stripes.""
